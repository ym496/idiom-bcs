This is both strike one, and strike two.<br/>
<br/>
Howard can't just stick you in doc review because of something I did.<br/>
<br/>
I told you this would happen.<br/>
<br/>
I screwed up!<br/>
<br/>
That came from a b*llet!<br/>
<br/>
That's it, we're getting you and Kaylee out of this house.<br/>
<br/>
Wallet!<br/>
<br/>
Let go!<br/>
<br/>
Oofff!<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">(Grunting)</em><br/>
<br/>
That all you got?<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">(Tires screeching)</em><br/>
<br/>
What did I do that was so wrong?<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics"><strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: You're like an alcoholic who refuses to admit he's got a problem.<br/>

<br/>
Wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Are the leeks too overpowering?<br/>
<br/>
Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
That's as good as the one we had in Florence.<br/>
<br/>
All right, don't humor me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
How was rehearsal?<br/>
<br/>
Did what's-her-name behave herself?<br/>
<br/>
She takes the whole section for granted.<br/>
<br/>
I'm debating whether to say something.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Don't keep it inside.<br/>
<br/>
Ready for the chiffonade?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[Knife scraping]<br/>
<br/>
And after all, if she's compromising the work...<br/>
<br/>
Mm. Well, it's debatable.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the Schubert is coming along nicely.<br/>
<br/>
It's more about morale.<br/>
<br/>
Morale can affect quality.<br/>
<br/>
God knows the hoops that Howard jumps through just to keep the troops humming.<br/>
<br/>
Well, true.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve a medal for this.<br/>
<br/>
Please. It's no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Your soy-ginger marinade?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I found a citrus one that looked good, so I thought I would try that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, you are a trouper.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Let's just say he's... something of an acquired taste.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, how bad can he be?<br/>
<br/>
Well, just in case, let's have a high sign.<br/>
<br/>
[Timer beeping]<br/>
<br/>
How about the old Carol Burnett thing?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, where she pulls her earlobe?<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
You do this, and I'll say I have briefs to read, and we'll get rid of him.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
[Timer beeps]<br/>
<br/>
You know why she did that... Carol Burnett?<br/>
<br/>
It's a great story.<br/>
<br/>
It was a signal to her grandmother, who had raised her, as...<br/>
<br/>
[Doorbell rings]<br/>
<br/>
Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
He's early.<br/>
<br/>
You're a doll.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
[Timer beeping]<br/>

[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit. Look at this place.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Jimmy, thanks for coming.<br/>
<br/>
Bring it on in here.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Little taste of home for you.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Had to look all over town to find a place that had it.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs] Didn't have time to wrap it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
You're good.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for a place.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Rebecca</strong>: Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Been staying at the Ramada.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for the help, by the way.<br/>
<br/>
I've found a few that I like.<br/>
<br/>
This one place, the Beachcomber, has a pool.<br/>
<br/>
And since the McGill clan is whiter than a pack of albino rats...<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
...I figure I better start working on my tan.<br/>
<br/>
So, seriously considering <em class="text-italics">that</em> option.<br/>
<br/>
I strongly suggest sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
We're up about 5,000 feet here.<br/>
<br/>
You'll fry.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent point. Sunscreen... check.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
So... a violinist?<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
And according to Chuck, a crazy talented one at that.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, wow.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Chuck is very gracious.<br/>
<br/>
She's being modest.<br/>
<br/>
Rebecca is widely respected amongst her peers.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Yo-Yo Ma came to our wedding.<br/>
<br/>
That's, um...<br/>
<br/>
Right on, man.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
About the wedding, um, I've been meaning to apologize... about that.<br/>
<br/>
I am truly sorry I wasn't...<br/>
<br/>
No worries, please.<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
So, tell us about your first week at Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.<br/>
<br/>
It was great.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, they got me workin in the mailroom, which... you gotta start somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I learned how to use the Xerox machine, which is surprisingly complicated.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, press a button, a piece of paper spits out... not anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Thing's practically a computer.<br/>
<br/>
It's like g*dd*mn space shuttle.<br/>
<br/>
It's got, like, double-sided printing, a*t*matic stapling, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Met some nice folks... guys and gals.<br/>
<br/>
Well, gal... singular, actually.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Learned everyone's name, and I licked a ton of stamps.<br/>
<br/>
My tongue is like hamburger meat... I mean, seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Unh, aah?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
I got... Thing's raw as hell.<br/>
<br/>
Then I found out there's a sponge for that.<br/>
<br/>
Oops! Rookie mistake.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, it sounds like you had a very productive week.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it was really great.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, guys, um... um, I want to thank you for having me over.<br/>
<br/>
This is, like, the best meal I've had in a decade.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the fish is perfection, and the, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Risotto.<br/>
<br/>
Risotto.<br/>
<br/>
[Smooches]<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. That's very kind.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you're a wonderful chef, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Aside from being super talented with the...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You got a good one, Chuck... I mean, lucky, lucky man.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, cheers to that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
[Soft music plays]<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
[Coughs] Pardon me.<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
[Bottle thumps lightly]<br/>
<br/>
What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a lawyer on a motorcycle?<br/>
<br/>
The vacuum cleaner has the dirt bag on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
[Both laugh]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Aha, lawyer jokes.<br/>
<br/>
I've only been in the mailroom a week, and I've heard maybe a hundred.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
It all comes from a place of affection.<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Of course.<br/>
<br/>
What do you get when you cross the Godfather with a lawyer?<br/>
<br/>
An offer you can't understand.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Very clever.<br/>
<br/>
Never heard that one.<br/>
<br/>
And believe me...<br/>
<br/>
I have nothing but the utmost respect for your profession.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's the pillar of... Oh!<br/>
<br/>
Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt?<br/>
<br/>
Because deep down, they're really good people.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs] [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Uh, w-what do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 60?<br/>
<br/>
"Your Honor."<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
What's the difference between a tick and a lawyer?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Rebecca</strong>: Oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
The tick falls off when you're dead! Bam!<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Love that one.<br/>
<br/>
You like that? [Chuckles] Just joking.<br/>
<br/>
I want you to know how seriously I take my job.<br/>
<br/>
That's great.<br/>
<br/>
I'm, uh, grateful for the... Oh.<br/>
<br/>
How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?<br/>
<br/>
Classic setup here.<br/>
<br/>
Three... one to climb the ladder, one to shake it, and one to sue the ladder company.<br/>
<br/>
[Both laugh]<br/>
<br/>
Comedy gold.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here all night!<br/>
<br/>
More. Go, go. [Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Okay. Okay, okay, okay.<br/>
<br/>
Dessert, anyone?<br/>
<br/>
We have a homemade blueberry crumble with vanilla ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, blueberry crumble... sounds terrific.<br/>
<br/>
I love a fruit-based, uh, blueberry...<br/>
<br/>
Wait. I think<em class="text-italics"> I</em> know one.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, bring it on.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Um, what do lawyers and sperm have in common?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, just... Um.<br/>
<br/>
3 million... No, wait.<br/>
<br/>
Um, 1 in 3 million... have a chance of becoming a human being.<br/>
<br/>
...a chance of becoming a human being.<br/>

<br/>
Love that one.<br/>

<br/>
[Crickets chirping]<br/>
<br/>
Well, that went well, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what you were worried about.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy's great.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. No, he's...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's going on tomorrow?<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Well, I've got the Gernstetter deposition at 10:00, back-to-back partner meetings after lunch.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't be a late one.<br/>
<br/>
Thought any more about what's-her-name?<br/>
<br/>
It's your reputation, too, you know?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Well, we start the Tchaikovsky on Monday, so I'll see what kind of mood she's in when we wrap.<br/>
<br/>
Smart.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement?<br/>
<br/>
Not enough cement. What?<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales sharply]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh.<br/>

Yeah. Mm.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Erin</strong>: Hi. Whoa!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I just thought everyone was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Nope.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here late most nights.<br/>
<br/>
Ah.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I noticed in your office... you threw away a soda can.<br/>
<br/>
You're going through my trash?<br/>
<br/>
No. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I was just dropping off papers at lunchtime, and I happened to notice it in your trash can.<br/>
<br/>
I fished it out, so it's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Office cans are for recyclable paper... there's a separate big can in the kitchen for plastic, glass, and aluminum.<br/>
<br/>
We take our ecological footprint pretty seriously here.<br/>
<br/>
[Printer beeps]<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so, the big can is where I should throw my empty Scotch bottles.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] No, I-I get it.<br/>
<br/>
Go green.<br/>
<br/>
Good. Was there anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, one quick thing. I have the brief you gave Cliff this morning... the Plaintiff's Opposition to the Defendant's Motion?<br/>
<br/>
I have a few notes.<br/>
<br/>
I think they're pretty clear, but it's probably easier if we just go over them together.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus. Th-Those are Cliff's?<br/>
<br/>
No, they're my notes.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love go to over them now, if you have a minute.<br/>
<br/>
It looks worse than it is.<br/>
<br/>
It's... It's just that we have a particular house style.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, no offense, but, uh, you're a second-year associate, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
And I came in as a fourth-year.<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
So, why is a second-year giving notes to a fourth-year?<br/>
<br/>
Well, like I said, I know the house style.<br/>
<br/>
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one associate helping another.<br/>
<br/>
Like here, the Roman numeral headings... we use all caps for those.<br/>
<br/>
And you indented them, which is perfectly fine, but Cliff likes them centered.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and before I forget, we put two spaces after a period on all our documents.<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems like a minor thing, but really looks so much cleaner on the page.<br/>
<br/>
You went a tad overboard with the quotations.<br/>
<br/>
It's okay to present a quote from a controlling legal opinion, but when you use too many, it disrupts the flow of your argument, and it gives the impression you don't know how to write an argument of your own.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] And I'm sure you do, so...<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] You have a tendency to overuse the words "clearly" and "obviously."<br/>
<br/>
Again, it's a matter of personal opinion...<br/>
<br/>
I really appreciate this, Erin, but, uh, I was just on my way out.<br/>
<br/>
So, if we could continue this first thing tomorrow morning...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I was thinking we should just get 'er done now.<br/>
<br/>
No time like the present.<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Let's roll up our sleeves and apply a little elbow grease.<br/>

Five minutes... just give me five minutes.<br/>

Here's how we're gonna handle this travesty of justice.<br/>
<br/>
Wexler vs. Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill... you want me to sue my own firm?<br/>
<br/>
Filing's all typed up. It's ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
This is not my area of expertise, all right?<br/>
<br/>
So, first order of business... we get a great employment-law attorney.<br/>

You're being mistreated.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck is punishing you to get to me.<br/>
<br/>
This is extortion, pure and simple.<br/>
<br/>
No, that's Howard, who has an image to uphold.<br/>
<br/>
He did the same thing after the Kettleman fiasco, and Chuck was nowhere in sight.<br/>
<br/>
I'm telling you... Chuck is behind this.<br/>
<br/>
No, <em class="text-italics">you</em> are behind this.<br/>
<br/>
I told you this would happen, and now I'm paying the price.<br/>
<br/>
I shoulda known better.<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm keeping my head down, and I'm getting through this.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Kim...<br/>
<br/>
Even if I won, who would hire me?<br/>
<br/>
That would be career su1c1de.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
Then I quit Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
What does that accomplish?<br/>

[Sighs] It's the only way to get you outta dutch because this<em class="text-italics"> is</em> about Chuck, whether you want to believe it or not.<br/>
<br/>
I give him what he wants... he lets up on you.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. My knight in shining armor.<br/>

That is some sacrifice... quitting a job that you've been trying to t*nk since Day One.<br/>

I'm an attorney at Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.<br/>

Kevin, true story... when I was 7 years old, my very first bank account was at Mesa Verde, if you can believe it.<br/>
<br/>
I can. Mine was, too, back when my dad ran the place.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I can remember the cover of my first passbook.<br/>

It was a silhouette of a...<br/>

Cowboy.<br/>

Do I have a future at this firm?<br/>

We have a lot in common, you and I.<br/>

[Cup thumps lightly]<br/>

My brother left you holding the bag.<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.<br/>

I made the same mistake over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
And now Howard has... and he blames you.<br/>
<br/>
It's a damned mess.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy ever tell you anything about our father?<br/>
<br/>
Not much, no.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
My dad... our dad... he was... well... the personification of good.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure he could even see sin in any form, like he was born without the gene.<br/>
<br/>
He ran a little corner store in Cicero... cigarettes behind the counter, penny candy... nothing special, but it kept food on the table.<br/>
<br/>
And the neighborhood loved Dad.<br/>
<br/>
He knew everybody's name, what was going on in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
This little corner... he made it better.<br/>
<br/>
I was named after him.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, he'd worked for a lot of people over the years, and his dream was to be his own boss... put everything he had into that place.<br/>
<br/>
I was away at college when he put Jimmy to work there.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy grew up in that store, watching our father.<br/>
<br/>
But Dad was not the world's greatest businessman, and eventually, he ran into money troubles.<br/>
<br/>
I, um, had a clerkship at the time, but I came home to help him get his books in order, set the ship straight.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm no accountant, but I discovered $14,000 was just gone, vanished over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it in dribs and drabs... just took it out of the till.<br/>
<br/>
My dad wouldn't hear it.<br/>
<br/>
Nope. Not his Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
He ended up having to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Six months later, he was dead.<br/>
<br/>
At the funeral, no one cried harder than Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
My brother is not a bad person.<br/>
<br/>
He has a good heart.<br/>

It's just...<br/>
