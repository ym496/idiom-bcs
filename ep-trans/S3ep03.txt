<br/>
What's our next move?<br/>
<br/>
 We gonna follow this guy?<br/>
<br/>
 [Cellphone rings]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: Changed 1261 to 1216.<br/>
<br/>
 My brother broke the law.<br/>
<br/>
 We can't just sit back and do nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: It's my word against his!<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, there's a tape.<br/>
<br/>
 Ernie told me.<br/>
<br/>
 For this, you destroyed our family?!<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy!<br/>
<br/>
 That's enough!<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck: You were a witness to what happened here?<br/>
<br/>
 I was.<br/>
<br/>
 [Insects chirping]<br/>
<br/>

 [Engine rumbling]<br/>

 [Rumbling continues]<br/>
<br/>
 [Rumbling continues]<br/>
<br/>
 [Brakes squeal]<br/>
<br/>
 [Air brakes hiss]<br/>
<br/>
 [Rumbling continues]<br/>
<br/>
 [Cellphone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
 [Cellphone beeps]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Man: May I assume that you are armed?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 I do not wish to see your g*n.<br/>
<br/>
 And if I don't, I promise you won't see mine.<br/>
<br/>
 Are we in agreement?<br/>
<br/>
 We are.<br/>
<br/>
 Expect two cars momentarily.<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles approaching]<br/>
<br/>
 [Engines shut off]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicle door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 [Insects chirping]<br/>
<br/>
 [Paper rustling]<br/>
<br/>
 You care to elaborate?<br/>
<br/>
 It's not in my interest for Hector Salamanca to die at this time.<br/>
<br/>
 Who is he to you?<br/>
<br/>
 An associate of an associate.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 How very specific.<br/>
<br/>
 Who is he to you?<br/>
<br/>
 We had a disagreement.<br/>
<br/>
 He threatened my family.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not gonna let that go.<br/>
<br/>
 But you had let it go.<br/>
<br/>
 You'd taken his money.<br/>
<br/>
 Your family was no longer in danger.<br/>
<br/>
 And yet, still, you robbed his truck.<br/>
<br/>
 Shouldn't that have settled the matter?<br/>
<br/>
 Most men would have walked away, but instead you made an attempt on his life.<br/>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 I understand that a civilian found the driver after you robbed the truck.<br/>
<br/>
 Hector m*rder*d this civilian, correct?<br/>
<br/>
 He wasn't in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't allow you to k*ll Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 However, I am not completely unsympathetic to your sense of justice.<br/>
<br/>
 You hurt Hector when you robbed that truck.<br/>
<br/>
 You hurt his business, his pride.<br/>
<br/>
 Quite effectively.<br/>
<br/>
 And if you were to hurt him in the same manner again, I would not stand in your way.<br/>
<br/>
 You want me to rob another truck.<br/>
<br/>
 If you feel so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm done with that.<br/>
<br/>
 Then our business here is finished.<br/>
<br/>
 That's it?<br/>
<br/>
 That's it.<br/>
<br/>
 No more tracker, no more of your minions following me?<br/>
<br/>
 Just like that?<br/>
<br/>
 Just like that.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course I trust that you are done with Hector Salamanca?<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes sharply]<br/>
<br/>
 Goodbye, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Ehrmantraut.<br/>
<br/>
 Wait.<br/>
<br/>
 You want his trucks hit because you want to disrupt his supply line.<br/>
<br/>
 Hector's your competition.<br/>
<br/>
 Why do you ask?<br/>
<br/>
 Because I'm not done with Hector Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>

 How may I help you today?<br/>
<br/>
 - Jimmy: Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 It's me.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, hey, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, um, something's come up, and, uh, I need you to reschedule all my appointments for tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, okay.<br/>
<br/>
 When do you want me to reschedule for?<br/>
<br/>
 Let's talk about it tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure thing.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, and, uh, do me a favor tell Kim I won't be back in tonight.<br/>
<br/>

 Chuck: You know you can wait inside.<br/>
<br/>
 You won't want to hear it, but this is for the best.<br/>
<br/>
 Please, Jimmy Whatever you think of me, whatever colorful names you're calling me in your head right now, please understand I'm trying to help you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Here's what's going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
 The police will arrest you, and I'm sorry, but I will be pressing charges.<br/>
<br/>
 I told you there would be consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 But I [chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 have to believe that you'll face those consequences and you'll come out the other side a better man.<br/>
<br/>
 I know it's hard to see right now, but, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
 That's why I'm doing this.<br/>
<br/>
 Not to punish you.<br/>
<br/>
 To show you, truly show you, that you have to make a change before it's too late.<br/>
<br/>
 Before you destroy yourself or someone else.<br/>
<br/>
 And I believe you can change.<br/>
<br/>
 You'll find your path.<br/>
<br/>
 And when you're ready, I will be there to help you walk that path.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Here's what's gonna happen.<br/>
<br/>
 One day, you're gonna get sick again.<br/>
<br/>
 One of your employees is gonna find you curled up in that space blanket, take you to the hospital, hook you up to those machines that beep and whir and hurt.<br/>
<br/>
 And this time, it'll be too much.<br/>
<br/>
 And you will die there.<br/>
<br/>
 Alone.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Run your hands through your hair, please.<br/>
<br/>
 Don't you wanna throw the book at me for old times' sake?<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 [clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
 Not how I'm used to seeing you in here, Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Not how I'd like to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you had quite the day yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr. McGill, you've been accused of fourth degree felony breaking and entering, which carries a maximum sentence of 18 months and a $5,000 fine.<br/>
<br/>
 We've also got petty misdemeanor as*ault.<br/>
<br/>
 Maximum six months' jail time and a $500 fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Plus, criminal damage to property, also misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of six months and a $500 fine.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Door creaks]<br/>
<br/>
 - Victim is Your brother Charles?<br/>
<br/>
 Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
 I assume you're prepared to enter a plea at this time.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 I wish to enter a plea of not guilty.<br/>
<br/>
 The court accepts and enters the defendant's plea of not guilty.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, Mr. McGill, have you secured counsel?<br/>
<br/>
 Kim: Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Your Honor, Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll be representing Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill in this matter.<br/>
<br/>
 Judge: Just in time.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's enter Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Wexler as the attorney of record.<br/>
<br/>
 Your Honor, if I may, um, I'll be representing myself.<br/>
<br/>
 I strongly advise against that, Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 You know what they say about a man who represents himself.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I I'm aware, but as you know, I've defended many people in the criminal justice system.<br/>
<br/>
 Your Honor, may I have a moment to speak with my client?<br/>
<br/>
 Sounds like he's not your client.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Mr. McGill, would you like to take a moment to discuss this with your potential counsel?<br/>
<br/>
 No, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm all set.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm gonna represent myself.<br/>
<br/>
 - Your Honor Not your client, Ms. Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm moving on.<br/>
<br/>
 You two can work this out on your own time.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I was gonna call you, but then I thought I'd tell you in person.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes sharply]<br/>
<br/>
 So, on to the issue of bond.<br/>
<br/>
 You have no priors and no outstanding warrants.<br/>
<br/>
 And where are you currently practicing law?<br/>
<br/>
 I haven't seen you in my court in a while.<br/>
<br/>
 Elder law.<br/>
<br/>
 Judge: What a noble pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
 One I hope you get back to very soon.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, given your ties to the community, I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<br/>

<br/>
 Chuck bamboozled me again.<br/>
<br/>
 That tape?<br/>
<br/>
 He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Because he knew Ernie, bless him, would tell me about it and I would come over to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 Howard was there, and a P. I. , if you can believe that, just waiting for me to lose my shit and bust in.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck played me like a fiddle!<br/>
<br/>
 And schmuck that I am, I fell for it!<br/>
<br/>
 Moron.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes sharply]<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 And then, I didn't call you, which is stupid, and I'm sorry about that, too.<br/>
<br/>
 But I didn't call you for a reason, okay?<br/>
<br/>
 'Cause this is my screw-up.<br/>
<br/>
 I own it, okay?<br/>
<br/>
 It's my responsibility to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
 And I know you want to help.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course you do, 'cause you're wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
 But y-you're up to your ears in Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 And I can't, I won't load this onto you, too.<br/>
<br/>
 We have worked too hard to let Chuck's bullshit vendetta thr*aten everything that we're building!<br/>
<br/>
 I won't allow him to endanger our business!<br/>
<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>
 I will fix this.<br/>
<br/>
 Myself.<br/>
<br/>
 Me.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay?<br/>
<br/>
 You have gotta let me do this on my own.<br/>

<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, sure.<br/>
<br/>
 It looks nice.<br/>
<br/>
 You mind driving me to my car?<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 No problem.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, just so you know, this isn't a typical week around here.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, [chuckling]<br/>

<br/>
 I believe our mutual acquaintance called ahead.<br/>
<br/>
 He told me what, but not how much.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I need a package yea big.<br/>

 So, how was it?<br/>
<br/>
 How was what?<br/>
<br/>
 [Crunching]<br/>
<br/>
 Your night in MDC.<br/>
<br/>
 I caught up with a few old clients.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 - Want one?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 This whole thing is a big misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 There's absolutely no way it's going to trial.<br/>
<br/>
 Who wants that hassle?<br/>
<br/>
 Not me.<br/>
<br/>
 Whichever lucky soul at the D. A 's office catches this, looking at an easy clear.<br/>
<br/>
 There's a felony in there, right?<br/>
<br/>
 That would be a cla Go ahead, classic case of overcharging.<br/>
<br/>
 No offense.<br/>
<br/>
 Happy to have a civil conversation, and I'm always ready to make a deal.<br/>
<br/>
 - Just call me Monty Hall.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 So you're looking to plea out on this, then, Monty?<br/>
<br/>
 If it's the right plea.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not perfect.<br/>
<br/>
 Made mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm willing to own up to them in a way that is satisfying to both myself and the state.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, good luck with that.<br/>
<br/>
 "Good luck with that" as in, "I wish you well," or, "I accept your challenge"?<br/>
<br/>
 I wish you well.<br/>
<br/>
 Play your cards right, they may go for it.<br/>
<br/>
 "They"?<br/>
<br/>
 Not you?<br/>
<br/>
 Prosecuting your case?<br/>
<br/>
 Nah, man.<br/>
<br/>
 It's not me.<br/>
<br/>
 You never catch a lucky break, do ya?<br/>
<br/>
 - Bad timing?<br/>
<br/>
 - No, conflicted out.<br/>
<br/>
 Conflicted out?<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, I figured that'd happen.<br/>
<br/>
 You and I have wheeled and dealed together too many times.<br/>
<br/>
 There was no way the boss was letting me run that one.<br/>

 Chuck: Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Hay?<br/>
<br/>
 - Mr. McGill?<br/>
<br/>
 - Chuck, please.<br/>
<br/>
 Meet me at the front door.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, they said to put my things in the mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, please.<br/>
<br/>
 Anything with a battery.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clattering lightly]<br/>
<br/>
 Did your brother ever have a key to the house?<br/>
<br/>
 Before the recent trouble, he did.<br/>
<br/>
 He brought me my groceries and sundries.<br/>
<br/>
 But we had a falling-out.<br/>
<br/>
 I have an employee who does all that now.<br/>
<br/>
 You took away your brother's key when you hired this employee?<br/>
<br/>
 I changed the locks.<br/>
<br/>
 Going Going back to the confrontation, so I have it absolutely clear, did he strike you?<br/>
<br/>
 No, nothing like that.<br/>
<br/>
 He backed me into a cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
 Did he have a w*apon?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, as I mentioned, he used a fireplace poker to break into my desk.<br/>
<br/>
 But he never would have used it on me.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you feel physically threatened?<br/>
<br/>
 My brother is a lot of things, but even he has limits.<br/>
<br/>
 And you're willing to appear as a witness even though he's family?<br/>
<br/>
 Unfortunately, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 If we continue with this, I'll need your sworn testimony.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I've had situations involving family members before where the injured party has ultimately been reluctant to cooperate with my office.<br/>
<br/>
 That won't happen.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm curious about your strategy.<br/>
<br/>
 Well as officers of the court, I feel we should be held to a higher standard.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't intend to take it easy on your brother just because he's a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course not.<br/>
<br/>
 The bone of contention is going to be the felony breaking and entering.<br/>
<br/>
 Your brother's gonna want to plead down to a misdemeanor, but I'll hold the line on the felony.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
 Which means this could possibly go to trial.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Now, I I want to be mindful of your comfort and well-being.<br/>
<br/>
 With, with your condition, are you able to appear before the court?<br/>
<br/>
 In person?<br/>
<br/>
 I certainly appreciate you accommodating me today by coming here, but don't worry, I'm able to tolerate being out for short periods with a few minor adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
 Nothing that will overly inconvenience the court.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll get started on this.<br/>
<br/>
 Unless you have other concerns.<br/>
<br/>
 I just I just keep thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 [Voice breaking]<br/>
<br/>
 You know, Jimmy has a good heart.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm, I'm sure he does.<br/>
<br/>
 It's not an excuse for what he's done.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 But he's my brother.<br/>
<br/>
 [Stuttering]<br/>
<br/>
 And I know well, he well, he's emotional.<br/>
<br/>
 He flies off the handle.<br/>
<br/>
 I understand, but this is more than flying off the handle.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not going to defend his actions.<br/>
<br/>
 But I can't help wondering if there's not a better solution.<br/>
<br/>
 For everyone.<br/>

 I found it in the glove box.<br/>

 I got a deal offer from the ADA today.<br/>
<br/>
 And?<br/>
<br/>
 It's not what I expected.<br/>
<br/>
 Bad not what you expected?<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 It's just that It's different.<br/>
<br/>
 She's offering me Pre-Prosecution Diversion.<br/>
<br/>
 Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
 A PPD?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 That's great, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
 Best I could hope for, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
 What does she want you to confess to?<br/>
<br/>
 All of it.<br/>
<br/>
 The felony B and E.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, misdemeanor petty as*ault and property damage.<br/>
<br/>
 I never touched him, but they got as*ault in there.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, could be worse.<br/>
<br/>
 As long as they never activate it, it doesn't matter, right?<br/>
<br/>
 You gonna be able to keep your nose clean for a whole year?<br/>
<br/>
 Keep "Viktor" with a "k" on lockdown?<br/>
<br/>
 It's not a problem, Giselle.<br/>
<br/>
 And if I don't, it's instant jail, right?<br/>
<br/>
 [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 Lucky break.<br/>
<br/>
 She must not want the hassle of a trial.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
 Guess so.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy this is good news.<br/>
<br/>
 And Chuck is gonna be pissed.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a big check in the "pro" column.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, the PPD was Chuck's idea.<br/>
<br/>
 Shit.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 What's his game?<br/>
<br/>
 One condition of the PPD is that my written confession is immediately submitted to the New Mexico Bar Association.<br/>
<br/>
 Your written felony confession.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I thought he wanted me in jail.<br/>
<br/>
 He just wants my law license.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 What are you gonna do?<br/>
<br/>
 Well I knew the bar was gonna be an issue, right?<br/>
<br/>
 So I figured I'd plea the charges down to a couple misdemeanors, get a censure, and maybe a little suspension, but a confession to a felony?<br/>
<br/>
 Grounds for disbarment.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 And if I take it to trial and I lose, I face the bar anyways and jail time, most likely.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 He's got me boxed in.<br/>
<br/>
 You can fight this.<br/>
<br/>
 The disciplinary board listens to extenuating circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
 No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.<br/>
<br/>
 Hell, he made half their careers.<br/>
<br/>
 It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.<br/>
<br/>
 Alone.<br/>
<br/>
 - Not alone.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 You need me.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't argue this yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 You and I both know that.<br/>
<br/>
 And I'm not gonna let you fight this on your own.<br/>
<br/>
 - Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 'Cause I don't [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Why would you [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
<br/>
 This guy?<br/>
<br/>
 Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
 Let's just call it the fallacy of sunk costs.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 So what now?<br/>
<br/>
 Now?<br/>
<br/>
 Now we, uh, take that PPD, and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.</div>
