<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Announcer</strong>: Previously, on "Better Call Saul."<br/>
<br/>
Last two nights, I heard g*n sh*ts.<br/>
<br/>
We're getting you and Kaylee out of this house.<br/>
<br/>
50,000 and the g*n is yours.<br/>
<br/>
If you're pondering a change, Schweikart and Coakley would be more than happy to put your talents to good use.<br/>
<br/>
I have no complaints about HHM.<br/>
<br/>
You took the Davis and Main job because of me.<br/>
<br/>
I took that job because it was the right decision.<br/>
<br/>
I got what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
You could have everything you ever wanted.<br/>
<br/>
What's not to love about that?<br/>
<br/>
What's not to love?<br/>

[The Stampeders' "Sweet City Woman" plays in background]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Man</strong>: Jimmy, how's that sweepin' going?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Going good, Pop.<br/>
<br/>
[Broom rustles]<br/>
<br/>
[Door opens, bell jingles]<br/>
<br/>
Hi. How are you?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Man 2</strong>: Hello, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could help me.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Well, I drove into the city this morning.<br/>
<br/>
U-Usually, I take the train, but I was in just such a rush to get some medicine for my son, Freddie.<br/>
<br/>
He has epilepsy.<br/>
<br/>
He had an attack this morning, but during his fit, he knocked the bottle of medicine out of my wife's hand and just... bam, one huge puddle.<br/>
<br/>
That's terrible.<br/>
<br/>
Well, long story short... drove into town, bought the new medicine with every last nickel in my pocket, and then my car died.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, God, that's... that's just, uh...<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] I know.<br/>
<br/>
When it rains, it pours, right? [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I-I tried the ignition, just nothin'... not firing.<br/>
<br/>
And, anyway, now I've [Sighs] convinced myself that Freddie's gonna have another seizure before I get back with the medicine.<br/>
<br/>
So, I-if you can help me, I would be so grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I could come out and check your car for ya.<br/>
<br/>
You know, maybe it's just a spark plug.<br/>
<br/>
I-I-I got a box of plugs back in the stockroom.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and I-I appreciate that, but if you could possibly just spare $5 instead...<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather grab a cab than take a chance with my old clunker.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, $5. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I-If you can spare it.<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay, sure.<br/>
<br/>
[Whispering] Pssst!<br/>
<br/>
Dad, come here!<br/>
<br/>
Come here!<br/>
<br/>
Dad, it's a rip-off, just like that bum from last week.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Every grifter in town knows that this is the spot to come for an easy handout.<br/>
<br/>
Grifter? Where in the world did you learn that word?<br/>
<br/>
Dad, his story's baloney.<br/>
<br/>
He probably doesn't even have a son.<br/>
<br/>
He's conning you.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy... what if you're wrong?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Y-You know what?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to bother you folks. I-I'm gonna get outta here.<br/>
<br/>
I-I'm gonna...<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
Dad.<br/>
<br/>
No, no bother.<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Now, here.<br/>
<br/>
[Cash register dings]<br/>
<br/>
There's $10 for you.<br/>
<br/>
[Cash-register drawer closes]<br/>
<br/>
Sir, y-you're... [Breathes sharply]<br/>
<br/>
That's... That is so generous.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, and... and you know what?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna go back in the stockroom.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna find those spark plugs.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll get your car started for you, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Just man the till, okay?<br/>
<br/>
And I'll just be back in a jiff, okay?<br/>
<br/>
[Footsteps depart]<br/>
<br/>
[King Harvest's "Dancing in the Moonlight" plays in background]<br/>
<br/>
How much for a carton of Kools?<br/>
<br/>
4 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, gimme a carton.<br/>
<br/>
Money first.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Gimme two cartons.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Man 1</strong>: Oh, gosh.<br/>
<br/>
These spark plugs are back here somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Just give me one more minute, okay?<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Come on.<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
There are wolves and sheep in this world, kid.<br/>
<br/>
Wolves and sheep... figure out which one you're gonna be.<br/>

<br/>
[Cash register dings]<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Just... Just...<br/>
<br/>
[Cash-register drawer closes]<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I-I found the, um...<br/>
<br/>
Did he leave?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, did he just leave?<br/>
<br/>
[Bell jingles]<br/>
<br/>
Sir!<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>

<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Mike</strong>: Don't let me interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hey. Sorry. You ready?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, come on. Let's get this over with.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for seeing us.<br/>
<br/>
We don't wanna take up too much of your time, so I'll get right to it. [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Um, I regret to inform you that with the benefit of hindsight, Mr. Ehrmantraut will be amending his original statement a tad.<br/>
<br/>
A tad?<br/>
<br/>
A wee bit.<br/>
<br/>
He's decided that he can no longer in good conscience claim that the g*n found at the scene belonged to Tuco Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>
So, whose g*n was it?<br/>
<br/>
Who's to say?<br/>
<br/>
You know how many g*ns there are in Albuquerque?<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere between the number of rattlesnakes and grains of sand.<br/>
<br/>
So... a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Was it your g*n, Mr. Ehrmantraut?<br/>
<br/>
No, he's not saying that.<br/>
<br/>
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] The g*n wasn't Salamanca's.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can tell you.<br/>
<br/>
You told us it was.<br/>
<br/>
You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he didn't.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you changing your story?<br/>
<br/>
Good citizenship.<br/>
<br/>
Look, there was only one set of prints on the g*n...<br/>
<br/>
Salamanca's.<br/>
<br/>
How's that gonna happen if it wasn't his?<br/>
<br/>
That's not really for my client to say, now, is it?<br/>
<br/>
He's not a forensics expert.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it, uh, fell from a passing bird's beak, and Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the possibilities are endless.<br/>
<br/>
Did Salamanca thr*aten you, Mr. Ehrmantraut?<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
We wanna put this guy away for years.<br/>
<br/>
The g*n makes all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
You know that.<br/>
<br/>
You gonna let this person victimize you twice?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Forget about the g*n, all right?<br/>
<br/>
The g*n was not Salamanca's.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to introduce it into evidence, Mr. Ehrmantraut will make himself available to the defense, and he will set the record straight, categorically and unequivocally.<br/>
<br/>
Did he thr*aten you or pay you off?<br/>
<br/>
Whoa! Okay, that's it. We're done. Okay. Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
[Door opens]<br/>
<br/>
[Door creaks]<br/>
<br/>
[Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
You're doing the right the thing.<br/>
<br/>
This Salamanca character?<br/>
<br/>
Maniac.<br/>
<br/>
I had my own... thing with him.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't wanna say it before because of conflict of interest, yadda yadda, but, yeah, he's nuts.<br/>
<br/>
[Whispering] I'm talking he had me hog-tied in the desert with a g*n to my head.<br/>
<br/>
Broke two guys' legs right in front of me.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn't talked him down, he probably would've...<br/>
<br/>
I'll spare you the gory details, but it was a deal and a half... not something you forget.<br/>
<br/>
And you're telling me this why?<br/>
<br/>
Don't be too tough on yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Like they say, discretion is the better part of valor.<br/>
<br/>
I would've done the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, today, it's on me... no charge.<br/>
<br/>
[Elevator bell dings]<br/>
<br/>
You take the next one.<br/>
<br/>
And bill me.<br/>

<br/>
[Ringing]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: Hey, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell Howard yet?<br/>
<br/>
I can't really talk right now.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't tell him.<br/>
<br/>
No, and I won't until it's rock-solid, like offer-letter-in-hand solid.<br/>
<br/>
When are you gonna get that offer letter?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I'm guessing next Thursday, after my interview with the partners.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but that's just a formality, right?<br/>
<br/>
Basically.<br/>
<br/>
I hope.<br/>
<br/>
What's the offer, you think?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, brass tacks.<br/>
<br/>
[Keys jingling]<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's not gonna be as much as your deal at Davis &amp; Main, but they'll make me partner in two years, as opposed to somewhere between five years and never at HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Not too shabby.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and then there's my law-school loans.<br/>
<br/>
What is that... a couple grand by now?<br/>
<br/>
I wish.<br/>
<br/>
I had to finance the whole thing and was only making mailroom money.<br/>
<br/>
I've got like $15,000 left.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Schweikart wants you bad, huh?<br/>
<br/>
But, J... [Chuckling] But, Jimmy, did you have something you needed?<br/>
<br/>
No, no. I was just checking in.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I'll see you later, okay?<br/>
<br/>
If you play your cards right.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Bye.<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone beeps]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Siren wailing in distance]<br/>
<br/>
[Telephones ringing]<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
Omar, where are you?<br/>
<br/>
Omar, would you be so kind as to take a letter for me?<br/>
<br/>
"Dearest Clifford..." No, that's too much.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply, snaps fingers]<br/>
<br/>
"Dear Cliff..."<br/>
<br/>
Whaddaya think... Clifford or Cliff?<br/>
<br/>
I don't... It depends on what the letter is.<br/>
<br/>
That's fine. Treat yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, "Dear..." whoever you put in.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing... Uh, "My heart is heavy as..."<br/>
<br/>
No, that sounds like a medical condition.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Let's go with, um, "It is with a heavy heart," okay?<br/>
<br/>
[Snaps fingers]<br/>
<br/>
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation to Davis &amp; Main."<br/>
<br/>
"Tender" is better than "submit," yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Resignation?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
So, "tender," blah, blah, blah, "to Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
These have been, uh, some of the most professionally satisfying days of my life..."<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think I'm laying it on too thick?<br/>
<br/>
No, um...<br/>
<br/>
I just didn't realize how unhappy you were here.<br/>
<br/>
Not unhappy, per Se.<br/>
<br/>
More like... not happy.<br/>
<br/>
I had no idea.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] It's not your fault, buddy.<br/>
<br/>
It's just... You're top-notch.<br/>
<br/>
Where were we?<br/>
<br/>
It's just y-you worked so hard to get here, and it's so much to [Chuckling] give up...<br/>
<br/>
I-I mean, the perks alone.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
The apartment is, uh... Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] And the car.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, the car is pretty sweet.<br/>
<br/>
And the bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
The bonus is a done deal.<br/>
<br/>
It's... They already cut me the check.<br/>
<br/>
I get to keep the bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Not if you quit.<br/>
<br/>
Before a certain term... I think yours is a year... you have to pay the money back.<br/>
<br/>
Mnh, uh...<br/>
<br/>
[Desk drawer opens]<br/>
<br/>
It's, um...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, uh, um...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, uh, yeah, it's, uh...<br/>
<br/>
I think it's right, uh, there.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[Tapping desk]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Omar... that whole, uh, letter-of-resignation thing that... I didn't mean that, not a word.<br/>
<br/>
I... [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I-I'm so incredibly stressed out.<br/>
<br/>
I'm stressed out the wazoo.<br/>
<br/>
And frank... to be honest, it has been more of an adjustment than I expected here at Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
And so I just... don't repeat what I said to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I figured something had to be wrong...<br/>
<br/>
I mean, [Chuckling] really wrong because you like it here, right?<br/>
<br/>
I love it.<br/>
<br/>
It... Call it a momentary lapse of reason.<br/>
<br/>
And but just...<br/>
<br/>
Let's just rewind the tape and, you know, forget this happened.<br/>
<br/>
Mum's the word. No problem.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I feel better already.<br/>
<br/>
I... You know, sometimes, you have to say something out loud to hear how crazy it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Omar.<br/>

<br/>
Can I have everyone's attention, please?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone can hear me? Good.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, this is not a conversation I ever thought I would have in my professional career, but it's been brought to my attention that we have an ongoing situation in the washroom.<br/>
<br/>
Someone is not flushing.<br/>
<br/>
Once is an accident... maybe even twice.<br/>
<br/>
Three times... no, that's a pattern.<br/>
<br/>
And we're not talking about a number one.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Thank you, Erin.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone... nor do I even want to know who did it, but...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Cliff, it was me.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, I just said I didn't want to know.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we need the water.<br/>
<br/>
I read somewhere that the Santa Fe watershed is down two full inches this year.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you flush a toilet, you waste a gallon of water... a gallon!<br/>
<br/>
What could be greater than this?<br/>
<br/>
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
From now on, flush.<br/>
<br/>
Low-flow... that's good.<br/>
<br/>
Good thinking.<br/>

Um, I got to say... you're right.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it really helps with stress.<br/>
<br/>
I know I don't sound very good, but I'm just learning.<br/>
<br/>
I heard that the key is you have to keep this bag inflated.<br/>
<br/>
[Sour notes play loudly]<br/>

You're fired.<br/>

What? Cliff, if this is about the bagpipes...<br/>
<br/>
It's not about the bagpipes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, of course it's the bagpipes.<br/>
<br/>
It's the bagpipes, and it's the not flushing and this... this optical migraine you call a business suit.<br/>
<br/>
It's about [Sighs]... It's about you keeping your bonus.<br/>
<br/>
That's what this is about.<br/>
<br/>
Been brushing up on your contract law, haven't you?<br/>
<br/>
You want outta here, clearly, but you can't just up and quit and expect to keep your bonus.<br/>
<br/>
And if I fire you for cause... like I should have done for the TV commercial... again, no bonus.<br/>
<br/>
However, if I fire you not for cause but for being an all-around jackass...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Hurray for you.<br/>
<br/>
If you think there's been some malfeasance here...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, save it.<br/>
<br/>
I could fight you on this, but you're not worth my time.<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather just have you gone.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
I'll just, uh... pack up.<br/>
<br/>
First... do me the favor of not treating me like a fool for once.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me... how exactly did I mistreat you?<br/>
<br/>
What did I do to deserve this kind of behavior?<br/>
<br/>
We gave you opportunities, encouraged you to excel.<br/>
<br/>
We got you a car, an apartment.<br/>
<br/>
Hell, that cocobolo desk.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see a desk like that in here?<br/>
<br/>
You never gave this a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make it work... really, I-I did.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just... a square peg.<br/>
<br/>
If you knew that, why did you take the job?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>

How much was the desk?<br/>
<br/>
$7,000.<br/>
<br/>
I'll write you a check.<br/>
<br/>
Fine, for whatever good that does.<br/>
<br/>
Take your desk and get out.<br/>

That's the deal, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Would you entertain a better offer?<br/>
<br/>
From whom... HHM?<br/>
<br/>
From me.<br/>
<br/>
I'll make you a partner tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Consider that proof of concept...<br/>
<br/>
Wexler-McGill, Partners at Law.<br/>
<br/>
You and me, together.<br/>
<br/>
[Breathes sharply]<br/>
<br/>
If Schweikart can pay your debt, so can I.<br/>
<br/>
And with my signing bonus, you'll have a clean slate.<br/>
<br/>
The sky's the limit.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we're good together.<br/>
<br/>
You know that.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's stopping us?<br/>
<br/>
Let's jump in with both feet, be our own bosses, build our own future.<br/>
<br/>
"Be our own bosses." [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
What about clients?<br/>
<br/>
Mesa Verde just signed with you, didn't they?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] It'll be a hard sell to take them with me.<br/>
<br/>
So, then there will be another Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
That was all you, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
You did it once. You can do it again.<br/>
<br/>
You make it sound easy.<br/>
<br/>
No. You're talking to a guy who lived in the back of a nail salon.<br/>
<br/>
No, this is gonna be a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears... at least, at the start.<br/>
<br/>
But in the end, we'll have a practice that is 100% ours... that's worth it.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Or we fail and we end up with nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you're right... it's a gamble.<br/>
<br/>
It's a big one.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but you're betting on yourself, and from where I sit, the odds are in your favor.<br/>
<br/>
You're an amazing lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
This is your chance to show the world that.<br/>
<br/>
So, why not go to Schweikart?<br/>
<br/>
They'll make me partner, and they are a solid, respectable firm.<br/>
<br/>
You can't deny that.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve more than just a lateral move.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line... that's what Schweikart represents.<br/>
<br/>
He's just Howard Hamlin by a different name.<br/>
<br/>
You keep talking about me and Schweikart.<br/>
<br/>
What about you and Davis &amp; Main?<br/>
<br/>
That's over. I quit today.<br/>
<br/>
Well, technically, I got fired.<br/>
<br/>
What happened?<br/>
<br/>
It was mutual and a long time coming.<br/>
<br/>
That job was never the right fit for me.<br/>
<br/>
This is.<br/>
<br/>
If we're gonna be law partners, I need to know one thing.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?<br/>
<br/>
I don't mean what kind of law are you gonna practice.<br/>
<br/>
I mean [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna play it straight, or are you gonna... be colorful?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna play it straight, right down the line.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna dot every "I," and I'm gonna cross every...<br/>
<br/>
There's no point in me doing this if I can't be myself.<br/>
<br/>
Every time I try to do things someone else's way, it blows up in my face.<br/>
<br/>
That's what happened at Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
Look how that turned out.<br/>
<br/>
I almost derailed your career, pissed everyone off.<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to be the person someone else wants me to be for...<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how long.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, first, it was Chuck, then it was you... and that's not your fault.<br/>
<br/>
That was my choice.<br/>
<br/>
But if we're gonna do this, I got to go into it as me.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Colorful, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say?<br/>
<br/>
I just...<br/>
<br/>
I don't see why it's so important to you that we work together.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, we're already...<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Why do you need me for this?<br/>
<br/>
I don't need you... I want you.<br/>
<br/>
You've got me... just not as a law partner.<br/>
<br/>
I have to get back to work.<br/>
<br/>
You okay?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
Go on.<br/>
<br/>
See you later?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[Footsteps depart]<br/>

It's move-in ready, as you can see.<br/>
<br/>
And they've renovated within the past three years... new floors, new kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
And it's a good amount of space.<br/>
<br/>
It's not too much house, you think?<br/>
<br/>
No, not at all.<br/>
<br/>
And look at that backyard.<br/>
<br/>
They're leaving the playhouse.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't that amazing?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Kaylee will go crazy for that.<br/>
<br/>
You'll never get her outta there.<br/>
<br/>
I know, right?<br/>
<br/>
And the most important part... the schools are good and the neighborhood is great.<br/>
<br/>
I called the local precinct and asked about the crime stats... they're some of the lowest in the city.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.<br/>
<br/>
Like, they sounded really responsive.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
<br/>
If you're happy, I'm happy.<br/>
<br/>
Do you like it?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I do, but I'm...<br/>
<br/>
But what?<br/>
<br/>
It's a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
I know... I'm like a broken record, but it is.<br/>
<br/>
You don't worry about that.<br/>
<br/>
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.<br/>

<br/>
We could go down to the office, get the pre-approval in order, all that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, sounds good. We'll meet you there.<br/>
<br/>
Sure. See you in a few.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I feel like I can finally breathe.<br/>

<br/>
Summary judgments? Uh, yes.<br/>
<br/>
I've handled six.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, one recently was quite complex.<br/>
<br/>
It was a litigation... the result of a [Inhales deeply] nasty divorce.<br/>
<br/>
My client was suing her former company, which she and her ex had split in their settlement.<br/>
<br/>
The issues involved had me chasing case law for weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Mm. Who heard it?<br/>
<br/>
Judge Pittman.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Oh.<br/>
<br/>
That guy... he's a handful, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Well, he can be a tough nut to [Chuckling] crack, but he did rule in my favor.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
All right, enough about law, law, law.<br/>
<br/>
We know you're good.<br/>
<br/>
We know you know your stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Lynne</strong>: You started in the mailroom.<br/>
<br/>
Is that right?<br/>
<br/>
I did.<br/>
<br/>
I was there almost, uh, well, 10 years ago now.<br/>
<br/>
Pulled yourself up by your bootstraps... I like that.<br/>
<br/>
I see you went to UNM Law. Are you from New Mexico?<br/>
<br/>
Not originally.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from the Midwest, just a tiny, little town barely on the map... you know, that Kansas-Nebraska border.<br/>
<br/>
You've never heard of it.<br/>
<br/>
So, what brought you here?<br/>
<br/>
I guess... uh, one day, I just looked around at my life, at who I was, and realized if I kept going the way I was going...<br/>
<br/>
Which way was that?<br/>
<br/>
Best case?<br/>
<br/>
Probably married to the guy that ran the town gas station.<br/>
<br/>

Maybe cashiering down at the Hinky Dinky.<br/>

It was our supermarket.<br/>

Always a pleasure.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Lynne</strong>: Great to put a face to the name.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: Oh, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
We are gonna put our heads together and discuss, but I feel safe to say that you can expect to hear from us by tomorrow at the latest.<br/>
<br/>
That's... fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to it.<br/>
<br/>
We liked you when you came in here.<br/>
<br/>
We like you more now.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you so much for taking the time, and I will, uh, [Chuckling] speak to you soon.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to meet you, Lynne.<br/>
<br/>
You, too.<br/>

Mm. It's Rich, actually.<br/>

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.<br/>

[Laughing] No, no, no, no. I'm happy to be confused with Howard.<br/>

Shit, yeah. Wow!<br/>

It's great.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
To that end... I have a pitch for you.<br/>
<br/>
Not Wexler-McGill, but Wexler... and McGill.<br/>
<br/>
We find an office, share the housekeeping costs, the rent, electricity... everything.<br/>
<br/>
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law, and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law, both free to practice as we see fit.<br/>
<br/>
Separate firms under one roof?<br/>
<br/>
We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?<br/>
<br/>
You do things your way, and I do them mine.<br/>
<br/>
We'll have freedom, but we aren't each trying to go it alone.<br/>
<br/>
Not partners... solo practitioners, together.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] I don't know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
Say yes.</div>
