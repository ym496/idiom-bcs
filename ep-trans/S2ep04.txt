02x04 - Gloves Off

<br/>
I can't believe Davis &amp; Main went for it.<br/>
<br/>
Did you actually think that was gonna fly?<br/>
<br/>
You can't...<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning, eight o'clock, my office, with the partners, and we wanna see this thing.<br/>
<br/>
There may have been some solicitation.<br/>
<br/>
I put myself on the line to get you this job.<br/>
<br/>
So what, you threw me a bone?<br/>
<br/>
It's my word. It's my judgement.<br/>
<br/>
You want next level pay, you gotta do next level work.<br/>
<br/>
You wanna tell me what we're doing here?<br/>
<br/>
There's a guy.<br/>
<br/>
I need him to go away.<br/>

My husband and I scrimped and saved for so many years.<br/>
<br/>
We did our best to build a nest egg so that we wouldn't be a burden to our family.<br/>
<br/>
After Ronald passed, I moved to an assisted-living facility... a nice place.<br/>
<br/>
They told me they'd take care of everything, but then, one day, they said all my money was gone.<br/>
<br/>
How could that be?<br/>
<br/>
Where did it all go?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: If you or a loved one is a resident of a Sandpiper crossing facility or other associated retirement community...<br/>
<br/>
Jesus. You used your own voice?<br/>
<br/>
Strictly to save money.<br/>
<br/>
All in, the whole thing cost...<br/>
<br/>
Just...<br/>
<br/>
Call the law offices of Davis &amp; Main at 505-242-7700.<br/>
<br/>
That's 505-242-7700.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
The production costs... $647, all in.<br/>
<br/>
The one single airing was a $700 ad buy, so dirt-cheap.<br/>
<br/>
You think this is about money?<br/>
<br/>
You think that's what this is about?<br/>
<br/>
I'm just trying to offer complete information here.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this one airing... it was an experiment, and as such, by any measure, a success.<br/>
<br/>
You keep using the word "experiment" like you're ‭the goddamned Wright Brothers.<br/>
<br/>
When exactly were you gonna tell us about this experiment?<br/>
<br/>
Today.<br/>
<br/>
This morning.<br/>
<br/>
I-I admit, I got a little ahead of myself, a little... Exuberant.<br/>
<br/>
And for that, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
But the headline here is... I think...<br/>
<br/>
We've gotten nearly 200 phone calls since this one airing.<br/>
<br/>
Cliff, since you and I spoke last night, 72 more.<br/>
<br/>
[Telephone rings in distance]<br/>
<br/>
You hear that? Right there... That's the sound of victory.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, stop selling.<br/>
<br/>
And don't act like ‭you don't see the problem here.<br/>
<br/>
I don't.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] You cut us out.<br/>
<br/>
You did an end run around us.<br/>
<br/>
Exuberance is no excuse.<br/>
<br/>
Cliff. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Client outreach is my department.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you told me that from day one.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, if I put you in charge of payroll, would that mean I'd be okay with you giving everyone a million-dollar bonus?<br/>
<br/>
You and I did discuss the possibility of a commercial.<br/>
<br/>
The possibility in the abstract, for a grand total of 30 seconds when I was halfway out the door.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I guess... I thought I heard enthusiasm, so I... I took some initiative.<br/>
<br/>
"Some." Wow.<br/>
<br/>
We are a team at Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
This is a team approach.<br/>
<br/>
You coming to us ‭as a solo practitioner...<br/>
<br/>
I knew there was gonna be a learning curve.<br/>
<br/>
But if you simply can't fit in as part of the team...<br/>
<br/>
I can fit in. I... I fit in.<br/>
<br/>
I am here to help you and HHM win sandpiper.<br/>
<br/>
That's all this was about.<br/>
<br/>
Sandpiper's not what keeps the lights on around here.<br/>
<br/>
We have clients who wouldn't want to be associated with this kind of... this.<br/>
<br/>
Our image, our reputation is something we've been carefully building for years.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth far more than any one case.<br/>
<br/>
Something like this could damage it.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice it to say, there's not a lot of love for you in the room at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
The vote is currently two to one to fire you for cause.<br/>
<br/>
However...<br/>
<br/>
I believe in second chances.<br/>
<br/>
But know this is both strike one and strike two.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, you can expect a great deal more scrutiny.<br/>

Come on. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: Hello.<br/>
<br/>
You've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
Please leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
[Beep]<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Kim. [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
I need you to call me as soon as you can, all right?<br/>
<br/>
It's a time-sensitive thing, so, uh, I mean, I may have, uh, just... well, please call me before you talk to Howard, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Bye.<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone vibrates]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Howard</strong>: It's a simple question, Kim... did you or did you not know about this commercial?<br/>
<br/>
I... yes.<br/>
<br/>
He showed it to me.<br/>
<br/>
He showed it to you?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. A few days ago.<br/>
<br/>
And you didn't say anything to anyone?<br/>
<br/>
No. I didn't.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't think I deserved a heads-up?<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realize... at the time, ‭I didn't think it was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you were wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
We were caught flat-footed in front of our co-counsel, which I don't need to tell you, does not reflect well on HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Or on you.<br/>
<br/>
That'll be all.<br/>
<br/>
You can go.<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to do?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Nacho</strong>: So, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I figure from here, you've got a good bead on the place, but someone inside... they can't pick you out.<br/>
<br/>
Tuco and me... that's our spot.<br/>
<br/>
He always sits facing out, makes it look like it's a gangster thing, but I know it's just so he can keep an eye on his ride.<br/>
<br/>
Every Tuesday, ‭we're here squaring accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Dealer comes in, pays what he owes.<br/>
<br/>
Tuco... he likes to get face-to-face.<br/>
<br/>
Says everything he needs to know is written right here.<br/>
<br/>
Looks 'em in the eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Just stares, like he's looking inside of 'em.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen him go like that 5, 10 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] And what does that accomplish?<br/>
<br/>
Calls it his lie detector.<br/>
<br/>
That's why these things go all day.<br/>
<br/>
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?<br/>
<br/>
Don't need it; we can handle our business.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it takes hours.<br/>
<br/>
Collect the cash, count it, lie detector.<br/>
<br/>
One at a time... guy comes in, transacts, then the next.<br/>
<br/>
Then, when we're done, Tuco gets in his car, I get in mine.<br/>
<br/>
Boom. We go our separate ways.<br/>
<br/>
That is where you come in.<br/>
<br/>
You see him packing up... wsssh... drive over.<br/>
<br/>
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.<br/>
<br/>
Pop. Head shot.<br/>
<br/>
Roll out. Easy.<br/>
<br/>
I-40 onramp is eight blocks up.<br/>
<br/>
You're in the wind before anyone has time to blink.<br/>
<br/>
And here's the beauty... all these, um, dealers?<br/>
<br/>
They know we're here, so the story is, one of them got ideas, decided to k*ll Tuco, get a cut of the business.<br/>
<br/>
Could've been any of them, as far as the cartel's concerned.<br/>
<br/>
These Tuesdays of yours... day or night when you wrap it up?<br/>
<br/>
Day.<br/>
<br/>
So, full daylight.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of traffic.<br/>
<br/>
How exactly do I not get seen?<br/>
<br/>
My car, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Murphy's law tells me somebody's gonna pull a plate.<br/>
<br/>
Fine. Go to the yard. Buy a beater.<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna stay in the car.<br/>
<br/>
[Whistles] ‭ain't no one gonna see you.<br/>
<br/>
And if they do see you, so what?<br/>
<br/>
That's why you're perfect.<br/>
<br/>
You're no one. You got no connections.<br/>
<br/>
You're a ghost.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
So, I pull in next to him... that assumes there's a parking spot.<br/>
<br/>
Our guys park next to him.<br/>
<br/>
They come and go from the same spot.<br/>
<br/>
Last one takes off, you're open.<br/>
<br/>
Someone comes in behind me, I'm blocked.<br/>
<br/>
Who's gonna pull in behind you?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.<br/>
<br/>
What then?<br/>
<br/>
What's my exit?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Get out and run.<br/>
<br/>
Bad knees.<br/>
<br/>
Look, the details... that's what I'm paying you for.<br/>
<br/>
You've got a better plan, go on, tell me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm all ears.<br/>
<br/>
You sure about this?<br/>
<br/>
k*lling your partner...<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles] That's a bell you don't un-ring.<br/>
<br/>
See this?<br/>
<br/>
You know how I got this?<br/>
<br/>
Back in '96, '97, Tuco and I were working with these bikers out of riverside county.<br/>
<br/>
They were running ‭this peanut-butter crank... real shit, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
But cheap, and we could sell it as fast as we got it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, ‭Tuco develops a taste for it.<br/>
<br/>
And crank does not bring out the best in people.<br/>
<br/>
Made Tuco erratic.<br/>
<br/>
Our connect was a guy called Dawg Paulson.<br/>
<br/>
One day, ‭Tuco's settling up with Dawg.<br/>
<br/>
He decides ‭to put on his lie detector.<br/>
<br/>
Dawg's like, ‭"what the hell?" You know.<br/>
<br/>
Tuco just keeps staring at him.<br/>
<br/>
Then he goes real quiet.<br/>
<br/>
"You think I'm an idiot, Dawg?"<br/>
<br/>
He thinks dawg is supplying his competitor, trying to cut Tuco out.<br/>
<br/>
Dawg... he denies it.<br/>
<br/>
"No way! Not me!"<br/>
<br/>
Tuco doesn't even ‭raise his voice, but suddenly, he's got a sawed-off and...<br/>
<br/>
Right in Dawg's face.<br/>
<br/>
I was behind him.<br/>
<br/>
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.<br/>
<br/>
And this?<br/>
<br/>
A piece of dawg's skull... under the skin, a little piece of him.<br/>
<br/>
I tried digging it out, but it's in there pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, not the kinda thing you go to the doctor's for.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about it was, Tuco really liked Dawg.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of felt bad afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
But when he's using, [Pops lips] Loco, crazy.<br/>
<br/>
There's no other way to put it.<br/>
<br/>
And he's using again, Crystal.<br/>
<br/>
Much bigger kick.<br/>
<br/>
So... it's like you said.<br/>
<br/>
If Tuco finds out about my, y'know, independent ventures, it's gonna be Dawg all over again.<br/>
<br/>
It's him or me.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
There.<br/>
<br/>
A man with a scoped r*fle could get a clean shot.<br/>
<br/>
Fire a single round, disappear before anybody knew what had happened.<br/>
<br/>
No witnesses. Clean egress.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty far.<br/>
<br/>
You can make that shot?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
You saying you'll do it?<br/>
<br/>
50 grand?<br/>
<br/>
50 grand.<br/>
<br/>
I'll look into it.<br/>

<br/>
Uh, he sent me to get his ink blotter.<br/>
<br/>
I'll just be a second.<br/>
<br/>
Watch yourself.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, thank you, Gesualdo.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the floor!<br/>

[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
Are you looking for Ms. Wexler?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I guess I'm too late, huh?<br/>
<br/>
No, she's still here.<br/>
<br/>
Where?<br/>
<br/>
[Door opens]<br/>
<br/>
[Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
Kim.<br/>
<br/>
I am so, [Chuckling] So sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I should have told you last night.<br/>
<br/>
You think?<br/>
<br/>
I honestly thought I could fix it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought they'd understand once they saw the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
I knew it would work, and it did.<br/>
<br/>
It worked. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Howard can't just stick you in doc review because of something I did.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, at an ‭entirely different law firm.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell kind of sense does that make?!<br/>
<br/>
I told you this would happen.<br/>
<br/>
He can't blame you for this.<br/>
<br/>
I warned you he would.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking to Howard.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
And call him a pig fucker again?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that'll help.<br/>
<br/>
I screwed up, you know? [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
I know that.<br/>
<br/>
But this... this is total bs!<br/>
<br/>
I'm... ‭I'm talking to him tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, no. ‭you'd only make things worse.<br/>
<br/>
I'll explain it to him. ‭no!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not asking you... I'm telling you.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Howard, you and I... we're done.<br/>
<br/>
So, we're not done now?<br/>
<br/>
I need this job.<br/>
<br/>
And there's a weekly billing quota that I'm about 40 hours behind on, so could you please just go?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>

<br/>
Aah!<br/>

Ow.<br/>

Okay. All right.<br/>

[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Lawson</strong>: That's the Armalite AR-50... state of the art, ‭accurate to 2,400 meters.<br/>
<br/>
I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now, but I can always upgrade you to a Schmidt &amp; Bender.<br/>
<br/>
Single shot, bolt.<br/>
<br/>
Simple, effective, reliable.<br/>
<br/>
It fires the .50-caliber BMG... very effective against soft targets in light cover... behind cars, ‭small-diameter trees, and such.<br/>
<br/>
As always, I've gone to the trouble of grinding down the serial number.<br/>
<br/>
Well, unless you ‭ground a hole clean through, acid will recover it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that would be true, but I follow up with a pass through ‭a random-stipple machine press.<br/>
<br/>
Hides the patterns in the metal density.<br/>
<br/>
Should throw off your x-ray diffraction and some other higher-end methods.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing's perfect, of course, but this is close.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like a hernia with a scope on it.<br/>
<br/>
34 pounds, not including your bipod, which adds some heft.<br/>
<br/>
Too much g*n.<br/>
<br/>
For most applications, I would tend to agree.<br/>
<br/>
SR-25 match r*fle... Eugene Stoner design, semi-auto.<br/>
<br/>
That's about 11 pounds there.<br/>
<br/>
Not quite the range or the punch of the AR-50, but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.<br/>
<br/>
At well past 1,000 meters.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard they're prone to jam.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's been known to happen in the field, but there's not a semi-auto built can boast it never jams.<br/>
<br/>
If that's a concern, you ought to stick to bolts.<br/>
<br/>
Good bolt-action r*fle... if you jammed it, I'd wager ‭you were setting out to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings us to the M40... tried and true, battle-tested.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, the same r*fle used by marine sn*pers since 1966.<br/>
<br/>
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets in the 800 to 1,2000-meter range.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to know this one.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You could say that.<br/>
<br/>
That's the a1 model.<br/>
<br/>
There's not much change from the original.<br/>
<br/>
Biggest difference is the stock... it's fiberglass instead of wood.<br/>
<br/>
It changed it over in 1970 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Good. Wood warped like hell.<br/>
<br/>
You get it wet, ‭you put it in the sun... gone.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody probably ‭should've figured that out before they sent it into a damn jungle.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Probably.<br/>
<br/>
If these aren't to your liking, I could get my hands on a few more.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
I've changed my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't need anything at this time.<br/>
<br/>
For your trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's no trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I make my living on repeat business.<br/>
<br/>
When you need what I'm offering, you know how to find me.<br/>

I could use some tea.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
[Spoon clatters]<br/>
<br/>
[Both sigh]<br/>
<br/>
Ohh.<br/>
<br/>
You scared me last night.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Happens sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I overdo it... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
It passes. [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Going into the office really takes it out of you, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
If I stay too long, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Guess it's hard not to stay.<br/>
<br/>
There's so many important things for you to do there... like, you know, stick it to Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
What did I do to Kim Wexler?<br/>
<br/>
She's back in the cornfield, isn't she?<br/>
<br/>
I didn't do anything to Kim.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I was present, yes.<br/>
<br/>
But management of personnel... those decisions are all Howard's.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] That is rich.<br/>
<br/>
But tell me, when Howard was makin' his "management decisions," was he sitting on your knee with your arm up his ass?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, can he talk while you drink a glass of water?<br/>
<br/>
That's uncalled-for.<br/>
<br/>
And if Howard were my puppet, he certainly wouldn't have recommended you to Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler who talked him into doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Hence his anger.<br/>
<br/>
Don't punish Kim.<br/>
<br/>
If you're mad at me, take it out on me.<br/>
<br/>

I know you like to think the world revolves around you, Jimmy, but this has nothing to do with you.<br/>
<br/>
Kim had a responsibility to Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.<br/>
<br/>
She should have been looking out for her firm's interests.<br/>
<br/>
Not letting us know what you were up to was her mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come on.<br/>
<br/>
You can't be pissed off at her about this.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Howard is.<br/>
<br/>
And why shouldn't he be?<br/>
<br/>
Because she didn't know.<br/>
<br/>
She didn't know ‭I was gonna air the commercial.<br/>
<br/>
She didn't know ‭I hadn't gotten it approved.<br/>
<br/>
She just... she didn't know.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Newspaper thuds]<br/>
<br/>
I see.<br/>
<br/>
So, she didn't know there was anything that she was supposed to tell Howard.<br/>
<br/>
As far as she was concerned, Cliff Main was already looped in.<br/>
<br/>
You told her he was?<br/>
<br/>
I implied it.<br/>
<br/>
So it's on me, not her.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Engine starts in distance]<br/>
<br/>
She didn't say anything to us about that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, she wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
Sh-she wouldn't want to make me look bad.<br/>
<br/>
You have to admit this shows a lack of judgment on her part.<br/>
<br/>
She knows you.<br/>
<br/>
She should have known better.<br/>
<br/>
You are such an assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
For pointing out that her one mistake was believing in you?<br/>
<br/>
For Christ's sake, can we get some perspective here?<br/>
<br/>
It was a simple, little commercial.<br/>
<br/>
It aired once... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
And can I remind you... it worked.<br/>
<br/>
It worked like a dream.<br/>
<br/>
See, that's your problem, Jimmy... thinking the ends justify the means.<br/>
<br/>
And you're forever shocked when it all blows up in your face.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
What did I do that was so wrong?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] You broke the rules.<br/>
<br/>
‭You turned Kim into your accessory.<br/>
<br/>
You embarrassed Howard, who... God help him... inexplicably vouched for you with Cliff Main!<br/>
<br/>
You made Cliff and his partners look like schmucks!<br/>
<br/>
Shall I go on?!<br/>
<br/>
How he hasn't fired you for this positively mystifies me.<br/>
<br/>
"Perspective."<br/>
<br/>
You want perspective?<br/>
<br/>
I'll give you mine...<br/>
<br/>
You're my brother and I love you, but you're like an alcoholic who refuses to admit he's got a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Now someone's given you the keys to the school bus, and I'm not gonna let you drive it off a cliff!<br/>
<br/>
Now, can we just get down to brass tacks here?<br/>
<br/>
What can I do to put Kim back where she belongs, huh?<br/>
<br/>
What... you want me to quit Davis &amp; Main?<br/>
<br/>
That's fine.<br/>
<br/>
I... I never wanted that job in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I can't get through to you.<br/>
<br/>
Life is not one big game of "let's make a deal"!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is! ‭[Chuckles] I'm Monty Hall!<br/>
<br/>
What's behind door number two?<br/>
<br/>
What'll it take, huh?!<br/>
<br/>
You want me to quit being a lawyer?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Ju... a chimp with a machine g*n...<br/>
<br/>
That's me, right, huh?!<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you say?<br/>
<br/>
You help Kim, I quit the law.<br/>
<br/>
Is that a deal?<br/>
<br/>
‭I didn't say that.<br/>
<br/>
No, you didn't say it, but that's what you want, right?!<br/>
<br/>
That's why you put the screws to Kim in the first place... to squeeze me!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't say that, ‭and I would never say that!<br/>
<br/>
Why not?!<br/>
<br/>
Because if I were impeding the career of one of my employees for the purpose of compelling you to do something against your will, that would be extortion.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. ‭It would. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>
<br/>
You gonna extort me, Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
It's a lead-pipe cinch you'd get away with it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not gonna tell anyone.<br/>
<br/>
It's real easy... you just set things right for Kim.<br/>
<br/>
You get her back in her office, out of doc review... everything back to normal, and I quit the law for good.<br/>
<br/>
No more Jimmy McGill, esquire... poof!<br/>
<br/>
Like he never even existed.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
But I need to hear the words come out of your mouth, okay?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] ‭You're a man of your word.<br/>
<br/>
You're an upstanding man, right?<br/>
<br/>
For God's sake, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Chuck!<br/>
<br/>
Extort me!<br/>
<br/>
Say "quit," and I will quit, but I need to hear it from your mouth!<br/>
<br/>
You want me to commit a felony...<br/>
<br/>
Because that's what you'd do, right?<br/>
<br/>
Because you want to believe that deep down, I'm some hypocrite!<br/>
<br/>
Let's find out.<br/>
<br/>
Come on down, Chuck!<br/>
<br/>
Roll around in the dirt with me!<br/>
<br/>
All your dreams will come true!<br/>
<br/>
Go on! Do it! Go on!<br/>
<br/>
I am not the bad guy here.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to be a lawyer... that's between you ‭and the New Mexico State Bar.<br/>
<br/>
You want to quit Davis &amp; Main? Be my guest!<br/>
<br/>
You clearly don't need any help from me to t*nk your career.<br/>
<br/>
You're doing just fine on your own.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, it's an hour's drive to Santa Fe.<br/>
<br/>
Even iyou leave right now, you're still gonna be at least 20 minutes late for work... another feather in your cap with Clifford Main.<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuck sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Door creaks]<br/>
<br/>
So?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not gonna do it.<br/>
<br/>
What... ‭are you negotiating now?<br/>
<br/>
No amount of money makes this a good idea... for you.<br/>
<br/>
Look, man, ‭I told you that I'm not...<br/>
<br/>
No, it's a bad move because it doesn't solve your real problem.<br/>
<br/>
My real problem? What's that?<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply] It's not Tuco.<br/>
<br/>
It's keeping a secret.<br/>
<br/>
A dead Tuco ‭draws salamancas like flies.<br/>
<br/>
The cartel noses into the business, looks for who hit one of theirs.<br/>
<br/>
You gonna be able to keep your secrets then?<br/>
<br/>
Something's got to give.<br/>
<br/>
With you, without you... I don't care.<br/>
<br/>
But something's gonna happen.<br/>
<br/>
You said it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
You don't need him dead... you need him to go away.<br/>
<br/>
You mean snitch?<br/>
<br/>
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco, who do you think the cartel looks at?<br/>
<br/>
Me.<br/>
<br/>
And if I call the cops, I get picked up, too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm what you call a known associate.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm locked up with Tuco, who's looking for the guy that put him there.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how that helps me.<br/>
<br/>
You won't have to talk to the cops.<br/>
<br/>
You won't have to do any time.<br/>
<br/>
There's no k*lling, but your Tuco problem?<br/>
<br/>
It goes away.<br/>

Uh, uh, y-yes, I would like to report a fight going on at the El Michoacano Restaurant in the 5000 block of the Isleta Boulevard.<br/>
<br/>
There's a man threatening another man with a g*n.<br/>
<br/>
It [Chuckles] Looks to be some sort of g*ng thing.<br/>

Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.<br/>

Uh, y-yes, sir.<br/>

That's mine.<br/>

You just ran into it.<br/>

No, I don't think I did.<br/>

Oh.<br/>

Uh, no.<br/>

Hey. I saw it, too.<br/>

You gonna stand here and deny it?<br/>

Um, guys, um, I... I don't know what to tell you.<br/>

I'm not aware ‭of hitting anyone's car, but if I did... I apologize.<br/>

I'm not messing around with insurance, ése.<br/>

Cash.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] Listen, I'm willing to accept responsibility, but if you're not going through insurance, then I have maybe 20, 30 bucks on me... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Kay, now you're lying to me.<br/>
<br/>
I saw your wallet. You got plenty in there.<br/>
<br/>
Take it out.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look together, jog your memory.<br/>
<br/>
You heard him.<br/>
<br/>
Take out the wallet.<br/>
<br/>
I just cashed my social security check.<br/>
<br/>
It's all I have till the end of the month, and I am not giving it to you.<br/>
<br/>

You're not?<br/>

Nah, homes.<br/>
