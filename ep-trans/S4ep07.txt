 It's always nice to be greeted by a friendly face.<br/>

 Now, over in this corner, we got a fireplace with a cozy waiting area, couch, couple chairs, water cooler, electric kettle, maybe an assortment of teas.<br/>
<br/>
 This is my office in here.<br/>
<br/>
 Guess what?<br/>
<br/>
 These are all original fixtures.<br/>
<br/>
 So, that's Uh, we're four blocks from the courthouse here.<br/>

<br/>
 [SIGHS]<br/>

 Get one of those snazzy Keurigs, put that in there.<br/>
<br/>
 Stick a few potted plants around, make the place nice.<br/>

 No, but this is what the phones were for.<br/>

 So, we get him smelling like a distillery, and we piss him off in court.<br/>
