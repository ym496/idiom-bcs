01x05 - Alpine Shepherd Boy
<div class="content">[Knocking on door]<br/>
<br/>
[Grunts lightly]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Officer</strong>: Albuquerque police. Hello.<br/>
<br/>
[Knocking continues]<br/>
<br/>
Sir, we'd like to talk with you for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
Could you open the door, please?<br/>
<br/>
Look, we know you're in there.<br/>
<br/>
You're casting a shadow through your peephole.<br/>
<br/>
All we want to do is talk.<br/>
<br/>
Would you please open the door?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I'd, uh, I'd prefer not to, officers.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Tommy</strong>: Sir, come on and open up.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I have a condition.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I can't go outside or be exposed to what's out there.<br/>
<br/>
You were able to come outside to steal your neighbor's newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: I didn't steal it.<br/>
<br/>
I left $5.<br/>
<br/>
The... the cover price is 50 cents.<br/>
<br/>
Did your neighbor consent to sell you her paper?<br/>
<br/>
I, uh... [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
She... I... Isn't...<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
L... um, officer, let's... let's...<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk about something called "probable cause."<br/>
<br/>
As I'm sure you know, in the state of New Mexico, there is a two-part test to determine whether police officers have an objectively reasonable basis...<br/>
<br/>
[Birds chirping]<br/>
<br/>
The situation a-as missing, versus Arizona, as I pointed out, uh, creates an event...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Tommy. Come around here, would you?<br/>
<br/>
And that's why the 10th circuit court of appeals ruled that a coercive order...<br/>
<br/>
Check this out.<br/>
<br/>
Requiring an individual leave his house is seizure...<br/>
<br/>
And, therefore, protected under the fourth amendment, right?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Tommy</strong>: Whole lot of camp-stove fuel.<br/>
<br/>
Guy sure as shit sounds like a tweaker.<br/>
<br/>
You see what he did to the breaker box?<br/>
<br/>
Is he coming out, or are we going in?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Officer</strong>: You got 10 seconds to open this door, or it's coming down. You hear me?<br/>
<br/>
Ah.<br/>
<br/>
Final warning!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll let you in, but you have to leave your electronic devices outside.<br/>
<br/>
No phones, no walkie-talkies, no flashlights...<br/>
<br/>
Definitely, definitely no tasers.<br/>
<br/>
I can't emphasize that enough. Deal?<br/>
<br/>
Or... look, look. I'll give the paper back.<br/>
<br/>
[Thudding]<br/>
<br/>
[Electricity hums]<br/>
<br/>
[vehicle approaches]<br/>
<br/>
[Beeps]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Big Ricky</strong>: Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, James McGill to see Mr. Richard Sipes.<br/>
<br/>
Ricky... call me "Ricky."<br/>
<br/>
Come on in.<br/>
<br/>
[Motor whirring]<br/>
<br/>
[Brakes squeal]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Keys jingling]<br/>
<br/>
[Exhales sharply]<br/>
<br/>
Uh. Uh, this is my assistant's car.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, my Mercedes is in the shop.<br/>
<br/>
[Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] I ought to give him a raise. You're right.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Big Ricky</strong>: Jim, I saw you on the TV...<br/>
<br/>
That billboard thing.<br/>
<br/>
And I had me a pair of insights.<br/>
<br/>
[Operatic music plays] Insight the first...<br/>
<br/>
You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<br/>
<br/>
And insight the second...<br/>
<br/>
You believe in the <em class="text-italics">real</em> America...<br/>
<br/>
Freedom, self-sufficiency.<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
I... I really do.<br/>
<br/>
When I see a man like you driving that foreign shitbox of a car...<br/>
<br/>
Well, see, actually, it's...<br/>
<br/>
It's a sign a good man can't get ahead today.<br/>
<br/>
It's a damned travesty. That's what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that may be [clears throat] Ricky, but, uh...<br/>
<br/>
I refuse to consider myself a victim.<br/>
<br/>
You know, we are once again at a point in our history where the fly-swatting hand of government is crushing the spirit of entrepreneurship...<br/>
<br/>
Taxes, osha requirements, the I.N.S. poking their big, fat nose into every mother-loving hire.<br/>
<br/>
It's damned oppressive.<br/>
<br/>
It's tragic.<br/>
<br/>
It's un-American.<br/>
<br/>
Jim, I think you are just the lawyer I need,<br/>
<br/>
'cause I got me a case... Major... I say, a major case.<br/>
<br/>
Are you ready to clear your calendar?<br/>
<br/>
[Glass thuds]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Ricky, I'm all ears.<br/>
<br/>
I want to secede from the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I got 1,100 acres of property here, self-sustaining with solar power and wells, a sovereign state immune to the business-k*lling regulations of the country in which it geographically lies.<br/>
<br/>
We are going to be America's Vatican city.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Ricky...<br/>
<br/>
I'm your man.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, let's do this.<br/>
<br/>
Let's show 'em all.<br/>
<br/>
Yee-haw!<br/>
<br/>
Yee-haw!<br/>
<br/>
Yee-haw! [Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Yes! We are doing this!<br/>
<br/>
Ah. [Glasses clink]<br/>
<br/>
Now, it's not gonna be easy, sir.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the government is gonna fight us tooth and nail.<br/>
<br/>
We could end up in the supreme court...<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking thousands of man-hours...<br/>
<br/>
I mean, years of effort.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Are you ready for that?<br/>
<br/>
Me?<br/>
<br/>
I say bring 'em on.<br/>
<br/>
Let's talk Turkey.<br/>
<br/>
What's your rate?<br/>
<br/>
[Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
$450 an hour.<br/>
<br/>
The hell with hourly.<br/>
<br/>
I want you on retainer.<br/>
<br/>
How about $1 million even...<br/>
<br/>
$500,000 up front and $500,000 when we're done?<br/>
<br/>
A million? [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
That seems... Fair.<br/>
<br/>
Would you like that in cash?<br/>
<br/>
[Footsteps]<br/>
<br/>
[Music continues]<br/>
<br/>
[Lock clicks, handle turns]<br/>
<br/>
Uh.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
Tax-free and backed by the full faith and credit of the sovereign Sandia Republic.<br/>
<br/>
It's, uh...<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Son... You are getting in on the ground floor.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
[Doorbell rings]<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McGill, hi.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for coming.<br/>
<br/>
Roland Jaycocks. Roland.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Roland. Great to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
You can call me "Jimmy."<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, hello. Please, come on in.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
God, what was it like climbing that billboard?<br/>
<br/>
Must have been pretty scary, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Guy needed help... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
You know, if I could do it, anybody could.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, my hat is off to you.<br/>
<br/>
So, here we are.<br/>
<br/>
And patent law <em class="text-italics">is</em> something you...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah. In fact, I... I do so many patent cases, I should probably just go ahead and specialize already.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] So, what do we got?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I feel silly asking this. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
But before I show you my invention, would you mind signing a non-disclosure agreement?<br/>
<br/>
You got it. No problem.<br/>
<br/>
It's my idea of a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
If Fisher-price or Playskool ever got their hands on this...<br/>
<br/>
No worries.<br/>
<br/>
You ready?<br/>
<br/>
I may have seen one of these before.<br/>
<br/>
Not like this.<br/>
<br/>
This one has this little unit I've added.<br/>
<br/>
This is my invention.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have children?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I have two boys... 4 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
And let me tell you... Toilet-training them?<br/>
<br/>
Nightmare, both times.<br/>
<br/>
They just didn't want to use the commode.<br/>
<br/>
So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip, and, well, no sense getting all technical, but it's all about positive reinforcement.<br/>
<br/>
Meet Tony the toilet buddy.<br/>
<br/>
And when you sit down to do your business, this is how he works.<br/>
<br/>
[Clanks]<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">Oh, yeah, that's the way!</em><br/>
<br/>
[Clanks]<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">Gosh, you're big!<br/>
<br/>
You're so big!<br/>
<br/>
My goodness!<br/>
<br/>
Look at you!</em><br/>
<br/>
[Clanks]<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">Fill me up, Chandler!<br/>
<br/>
Put it in me!</em><br/>
<br/>
Chandler's my youngest... loves it.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
[Clanks]<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">Give it to me, Chandler! I want it all!<br/>
<br/>
Mmm!<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh!</em><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it goes on from there.<br/>
<br/>
You get the picture.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
It's a little sexual, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Sexual? What... what does that...<br/>
<br/>
Suggestive, maybe...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that's a better word. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'm not...<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying this thing won't make you rich.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, some of your wealthier pacific rim nations...<br/>
<br/>
They'll love this... the crazy b*stards.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I created this for children... Children, understand?<br/>
<br/>
Well, hey, Viagra was originally invented to treat hypertension.<br/>
<br/>
Look how that turned out.<br/>
<br/>
You're completely disgusting, you know that?!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, buddy, you're the one with the sex toilet.<br/>
<br/>
Get off my property!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you know what?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you do make a fortune,<br/>
<br/>
'cause Chandler's gonna need it to help pay for his therapy!<br/>
<br/>
[Brakes squeal]<br/>
<br/>
[Gearshift clicks]<br/>
<br/>
[Engine clicking, shuts off]<br/>
<br/>
[Whirring]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I found the alpine Shepherd boy!<br/>
<br/>
[Whirring continues]<br/>
<br/>
[Sniffles]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighing]<br/>
<br/>
[Whirring stops]<br/>
<br/>
[Beeping]<br/>
<br/>
No, no. You just stay put.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right over.<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
[Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Now, where were we?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, would you like some more tea?<br/>
<br/>
No! No, thank you. I'm... I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the Shepherd boy Hummel...<br/>
<br/>
That's gonna go to your nephew Clarence?<br/>
<br/>
As long as he finishes college. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
If he drops out, it goes to my niece Raylene.<br/>
<br/>
But then, Raylene doesn't get the girl...<br/>
<br/>
The girl with the geese. Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. No, then that would go to your cousin Helen...<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
So long as she never remarries Frederick?<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
And no matter what, I want the towheaded twins to go to Reverend Lawrence's grandson.<br/>
<br/>
Um, don't you mean Reverend Hanes?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause Reverend<em class="text-italics"> Lawrence's</em> grandson is going to get the, uh, lute-playing angel, 'cause he was in the choir.<br/>
<br/>
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] No, only half of us are idiots.<br/>
<br/>
The other half are crooks.<br/>
<br/>
[Both laugh]<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you a spicy one?<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
If I were 40 years younger, I'd have you buy me a piña colada.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR, I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.<br/>
<br/>
[Both laugh] I knew I'd like you when I saw how you saved that poor man on the television.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
Moxie is in such short supply these days.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I pride myself on my moxie.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I hate to do this, but I do need to bring up my payment.<br/>
<br/>
Um [Clears throat] and I'm sorry, but I can't accept s&amp;h green stamps.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Now, uh, my fee is $140.<br/>
<br/>
$140?<br/>
<br/>
I'll gladly accept $70 today and $70 when I come back with the completed documents, if...<br/>
<br/>
[Rustling]<br/>
<br/>
$20, $40, $60...<br/>
<br/>
$80, $100...<br/>
<br/>
And $20, $40.<br/>
<br/>
Uh. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: Put it on the nail, not the skin.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: I can't help it if your toes are too small.<br/>
<br/>
They should all be the same size...<br/>
<br/>
The size of the big toe.<br/>
<br/>
That one I can do.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that would be attractive.<br/>
<br/>
[Both chuckle]<br/>
<br/>
So... how's it go again?<br/>
<br/>
[Imitating Tony the toilet buddy] Oh, you're huge, Chandler!<br/>
<br/>
You're a big, big boy!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, where does it end?!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, don't stop, Chandler!<br/>
<br/>
Don't stop! [Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, here it comes!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what is that?<br/>
<br/>
Is that a piece of corn?<br/>
<br/>
[Laughing] No, don't.<br/>
<br/>
Did you eat corn, Chandler?<br/>
<br/>
Is that a niblet I see, Chandler?<br/>
<br/>
That's disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
No, don't.<br/>
<br/>
[Normal voice] Too much?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, good times.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Even your lousy days are more interesting than my<em class="text-italics"> good</em> ones.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, we should definitely do something about that.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, don't ever try to make a living at this.<br/>
<br/>
Stick with the law.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, because I'm really...<br/>
<br/>
Lighting the world on fire in that department.<br/>
<br/>
Did two wills today.<br/>
<br/>
Two wills, and I started a living trust.<br/>
<br/>
Whoopee! Old people love me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you got a future in elder law.<br/>
<br/>
You think I could handle all that glamour?<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm serious.<br/>
<br/>
I... I've thought about getting into elder law myself.<br/>
<br/>
I watched my grandmother at the end.<br/>
<br/>
It's...<br/>
<br/>
It's awful what people have to deal with...<br/>
<br/>
Insurance companies, my scumbag cousins stealing her savings and her pain meds.<br/>
<br/>
Getting old sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Seniors need someone on their side.<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
It's Howard.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell does<em class="text-italics"> he</em> want?<br/>
<br/>
Shh!<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone beeps]<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, no. I mean, I haven't, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God. When?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay.<br/>
<br/>
I'll see if I can, um, track Jimmy down.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call you back. S-sure.<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone beeps]<br/>
<br/>
It's Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
[Electricity buzzing]<br/>
<br/>
[Buzzing intensifies]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, you with me?<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, hey, buddy. It's me.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, can you talk to me? Jim...<br/>
<br/>
Jesus Christ. These sons of b*tches.<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing sharply]<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey. Sir, you can't do that.<br/>
<br/>
All of this needs to stay on.<br/>
<br/>
No, no. No electricity.<br/>
<br/>
You understand?<br/>
<br/>
No, it needs to be on.<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting security.<br/>
<br/>
No, uh, wait, wait.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, wait. Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Huh? Why isn't that one going out?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy. Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Damn it.<br/>
<br/>
I just... Jimmy, wait a second. Jimmy. Think.<br/>
<br/>
What's the plan here?<br/>
<br/>
Sir? Sir?<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I need you to get down from there.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell kind of t*rture chamber you running here?<br/>
<br/>
He... he's allergic to electricity, all right?<br/>
<br/>
You heard the doc. Get down now.<br/>
<br/>
No, all these lights and machines...<br/>
<br/>
You might as well throw him into a microwave.<br/>
<br/>
Come on down now.<br/>
<br/>
No, don't touch me!<br/>
<br/>
He is this patient's brother. Please, listen to him.<br/>
<br/>
[Remote control beeps]<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing heavily]<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Dr. Cruz</strong>: Hey. Wait, Edwin, hold up.<br/>
<br/>
Hold on a second, Edwin.<br/>
<br/>
Sir, are you ready to calm down now?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. His name is Jimmy, and, yes, he is gonna calm down.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to say the words, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I need to hear it from you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.<br/>
<br/>
Edwin, why don't you go wait in the hallway?<br/>
<br/>
I'll call if we need you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so, tell me about the electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, look, I know how it sounds, but it's real.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, shit.<br/>
<br/>
My phone and stuff... Anything with a battery in it...<br/>
<br/>
He can't have it near him.<br/>
<br/>
Hang on.<br/>
<br/>
Here's my phone. Okay, that's it.<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing heavily] Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, what the hell happened to him?<br/>
<br/>
Why is he here?<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, it started when Charles stole his neighbor's newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
What? He... he never leaves the house.<br/>
<br/>
I don't... I don't have all the details, but the police found him in a very agitated state.<br/>
<br/>
He was confrontational and incoherent.<br/>
<br/>
How come you didn't call me?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, why did I have to hear about this through my brother's prick of a law partner?<br/>
<br/>
The only contact information we could find was a business card.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, in my opinion, Charles should be committed for 30 days of psychiatric observation.<br/>
<br/>
As a family member, you can submit a petition for him to be evaluated.<br/>
<br/>
There's an excellent facility in Las Cruces.<br/>
<br/>
He can be there tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I'd rather not. [Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hey, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>

Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know why you're in the hospital?<br/>
<br/>
The police kicked in my door... No warrant, no cause.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't incoherent.<br/>
<br/>
They just weren't listening.<br/>
<br/>
They tasered me, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Aw, Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Kim?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. I can give you privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. Stay.<br/>
<br/>
Howard... Called me.<br/>
<br/>
He's very concerned about you.<br/>
<br/>
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, do... do you have a phone or a... a pager, anything with a battery?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think so. I...<br/>
<br/>
Uh...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing quickly]<br/>
<br/>
Oversight. Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell me a little more about your... Situation?<br/>
<br/>
It's not a situation.<br/>
<br/>
It's a condition...<br/>
<br/>
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.<br/>
<br/>
For reasons unknown, my nervous system has become sensitized to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.<br/>
<br/>
Your brother called it an allergy to electricity.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's an oversimplification, but it's essentially correct.<br/>
<br/>
Electronic devices create their own electromagnetic fields.<br/>
<br/>
The closer I am to such devices, the worse my symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
Which are?<br/>
<br/>
Burning sensation on my skin, a sharp, cold pain in my bones, muscle fatigue, heart palpitations, blurred vision, tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath, a general... it hurts.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it hurts.<br/>
<br/>
When did you first experience these symptoms?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Oh, it must have been...<br/>
<br/>
Y... you left the office 18 months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Huh. Well, in that case, uh, must have been almost two years.<br/>
<br/>
Two years?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
That's a... that's a long time to live with discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
You think I'm crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I never said that.<br/>
<br/>
No, you didn't, because you're very polite, but you think it.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking about commitment.<br/>
<br/>
You find that idea distressing.<br/>
<br/>
Who the hell wouldn't?<br/>
<br/>
I... I find it inappropriate for a person suffering from a physical condition.<br/>
<br/>
[Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me knows that this isn't some kind of delusion.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Of course she does.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm not a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
You've known me for the better part of a decade.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign...<br/>
<br/>
Any sign whatsoever of mental illness?<br/>
<br/>
See?<br/>
<br/>
If I thought for one second you could cure me, believe me, I'd jump at the chance.<br/>
<br/>
But with all due respect, psychiatry doesn't have the answers.<br/>
<br/>
I'd very much like to try.<br/>
<br/>
Section 43-1-11, part (E)(3)...<br/>
<br/>
"The proposed commitment is consistent with the treatment needs of the client and with the least drastic means principle."<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: Do you think subjecting me to this kind of pain for a month is the least drastic means?<br/>
<br/>
He might as well spend a month in a wood chipper.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Dr. Cruz</strong>: I understand your frustration. I do.<br/>
<br/>
You're obviously a highly intelligent man in difficult circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
May I ask you a question, just for my own interest?<br/>
<br/>
How do you meet the needs of daily life?<br/>
<br/>
What do you do for light, or...<br/>
<br/>
How do you prepare food?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I use white-gas lanterns.<br/>
<br/>
For cooking, I have a camp stove.<br/>
<br/>
I have a large cooler I keep filled with ice.<br/>
<br/>
It's not ideal, but I make do.<br/>
<br/>
I see.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind if I took a moment to speak with your brother?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, uh, make sure you still have your wallet when you're done.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Funny guy.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I want to go home.<br/>
<br/>
[Intercom chatter]<br/>
<br/>
That was a dirty trick.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn't a trick... It was a demonstration.<br/>
<br/>
This allergy to electricity isn't real...<br/>
<br/>
It's a manifestation of something deeper.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying it's 100% real, okay?<br/>
<br/>
But Chuck is smarter than you and me put together, so we're not talking him out of this, and I'm not sending him to a rubber room.<br/>
<br/>
No one is talking about rubber rooms.<br/>
<br/>
There are specialists who will...<br/>
<br/>
He's seen specialists, okay?<br/>
<br/>
The best doctors from here to Denver, and none of them helped... not one.<br/>
<br/>
So you're ready to give up.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] Who's giving up, huh?<br/>
<br/>
I'm... I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.<br/>
<br/>
That white gas he was talking about...<br/>
<br/>
Who do you think brings him that?<br/>
<br/>
And milk and bread and toilet paper and ice and every other damn thing he needs.<br/>
<br/>
Is that helping or enabling?<br/>
<br/>
If you testify in a custodial hearing, he can get the help he needs... That's in your power.<br/>
<br/>
To be committed involuntarily, he has to be a danger to himself or others.<br/>
<br/>
And he is.<br/>
<br/>
Coleman lanterns indoors, a camp stove?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, he could burn his house down or the entire neighborhood, and then you're looking at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
What if...<br/>
<br/>
What if he just hurts himself in a household accident?<br/>
<br/>
How does he call for help?<br/>
<br/>
You have the power to help your brother...<br/>
<br/>
Truly help him.<br/>
<br/>
Ignoring this won't make it go away.<br/>
<br/>
What would<em class="text-italics"> you</em> do?<br/>
<br/>
All I know is...<br/>
<br/>
He needs help.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Untie him.<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting him out of here.<br/>
<br/>
A nurse will bring you the release forms.<br/>
<br/>
[Keys jingling]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, boy.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy. Jimmy. I found him.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd wait till you got here.<br/>
<br/>
Great. How's he doing?<br/>
<br/>
Better. Resting.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Jimmy...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to know that I've talked to the D.A., and he absolutely will not sign off on any commitment papers.<br/>
<br/>
This is a<em class="text-italics"> physical</em> condition, not a mental one.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck is of sound mind.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can all agree on that.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
You're a real peach, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you don't want Chuck committed.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't. Why would I?<br/>
<br/>
Because if Chuck were committed, then I'd become his legal guardian, and I cash him out of HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Jimmy. Now?<br/>
<br/>
You want to hash that out while he's lying in here?<br/>
<br/>
You know, the tanning bed must have melted your brain if you think for one second...<br/>
<br/>
Guys... Chuck. That's why we're here.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Let's stay on point.<br/>
<br/>
We're talking about the well-being of a man whom we all love very much.<br/>
<br/>
There's many factors at play.<br/>
<br/>
Spite doesn't have to be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Howard?<br/>
<br/>
I was on the fence till you showed up, but thanks for helping me decide.<br/>
<br/>
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow,<br/>
<br/>
'cause it's leaving the pasture.<br/>
<br/>
I'm committing him.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy. Uh, j... wait.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, wait. Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, can you wait?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, wait a second.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help, and maybe it's the right thing to do, but you can't do it like this.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to see that son of a b*tch sweat.<br/>
<br/>
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
I'm taking my brother home.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: There you go, buddy.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
There you go.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, some steps. One and two.<br/>
<br/>
And there you go.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you're home, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Everything's gonna be all right.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you want something to eat...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, some tea... a cup of tea?<br/>
<br/>
Coffee?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Coffee. Coffee it is.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Jimmy, I'm... I'm... I'm gonna need my...<br/>
<br/>
I don't... I... I... I... I...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's...<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing heavily]<br/>
<br/>
[Groaning]<br/>
<br/>
You want to talk about this?<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
You took the paper.<br/>
<br/>
You saw this.<br/>
<br/>
You got sick.<br/>
<br/>
What's your point?<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, I think you got sick 'cause you saw this story.<br/>
<br/>
No, w... whenever you think I've done something wrong, something questionable, you get worse.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't get sick because I read about you in the paper.<br/>
<br/>
I got sick because I went out of my house to retrieve the paper.<br/>
<br/>
W... [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I... I've had it too many times.<br/>
<br/>
You think this is the return of slippin' Jimmy, but it's not. All right.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you think the billboard thing was unethical, but it was... Promotion.<br/>
<br/>
It was advertising... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Which wasn't even allowed until five supreme court justices went completely bonkers in Bates vs. State bar of Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
Aha!<br/>
<br/>
But in any event...<br/>
<br/>
It's legal.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to advertise, that's your business.<br/>
<br/>
"Business" being the operative word there, Chuck, because I-I<em class="text-italics"> have</em> gotten business off of this...<br/>
<br/>
Legit business... wills, uh, trusts.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I'm... I'm kind of starting to specialize in elder law.<br/>
<br/>
Elder law?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the things the elderly have to deal with...<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you know, relatives coming after their savings, telemarketers, reverse-mortgage scams...<br/>
<br/>
I mean, getting old sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Seniors need someone on their side, so...<br/>
<br/>
You're looking at him.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that sounds...<br/>
<br/>
Promising.<br/>
<br/>
But it has nothing to do with my condition.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, listen. I'm gonna make you a promise right now, okay?<br/>
<br/>
No, not necessary, not requested.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
The billboard was a one-time thing.<br/>
<br/>
I... I'm a good lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
I just needed some razzmatazz, you know, to get the ball rolling, some showmanship...<br/>
<br/>
That's all it was.<br/>
<br/>
It's done now. It's over.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
From here on out, I'm gonna play by the rules.<br/>
<br/>
As any lawyer should.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
There are clients out there who need me, and I'm gonna give them the best representation I know how to provide.<br/>
<br/>
I... I'm on the up-and-up, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I will be good.<br/>
<br/>
Slippin' Jimmy...<br/>

He's back in Cicero, dead and buried.<br/>

Okay.<br/>

We'll see.<br/>

<br/>
Hello, there.<br/>
<br/>
James McGill, attorney at law.<br/>
<br/>
How are you this fine morning?<br/>
<br/>
I'm just fine. And how about you?<br/>
<br/>
Very good.<br/>
<br/>
Play fair.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what do we got here?<br/>
<br/>
[Straining] I see.<br/>
<br/>
A piece is trying to get away.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the jello.<br/>
<br/>
Get to the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Who's the banker here?<br/>
<br/>
That's the only one I want to talk to. There he is.<br/>
<br/>
Hey. How are ya?<br/>
<br/>
I'm good. Whoa! What a grip, young man!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, watch out.<br/>
<br/>
That's my will-writing hand.<br/>
<br/>
[Speaks indistinctly]<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, ladies. You look beautiful today.<br/>
<br/>
All right over there?<br/>
<br/>
Very good. Play fair.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, no betting.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait a second. Is that Veronica lake?<br/>
<br/>
Give me a hug, beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. You look great today.<br/>
<br/>
All right, no cheating. No hiding the tablet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what do we have here?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, there he is... the man in the booth, John Wilkes booth, booth Tarkington.<br/>
<br/>
What you reading there?<br/>
<br/>
"The complete annotated book of rules for parking validation"?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
The rules for parking validation are actually pretty simple.<br/>
<br/>
Most people get it on the first try.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you'll be pleased to know I have the requisite stickers.<br/>
<br/>
Well, be still my heart.<br/>
<br/>
And...<br/>
<br/>
You can have this, as well.<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing elder law now.<br/>
<br/>
Need a will? Call McGill.<br/>
<br/>
So, give me a call if you, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, if, uh, you happen to know any elders.<br/>

Good night.<br/>
