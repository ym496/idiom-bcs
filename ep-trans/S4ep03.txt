04x03 - Something Beautiful
<div class="content">Previously on "Better Call Saul" Welcome to the team.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not taking the job!<br/>
<br/>
 Suckers.<br/>
<br/>
 She's proven she can field whatever we throw at her and then some.<br/>
<br/>
 I promised you Mesa Verde would be my sole focus, and I meant it.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, what's this?!<br/>
<br/>
 One last "Screw you, little brother" from beyond the grave?!<br/>
<br/>
 I got something for you.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a job.<br/>
<br/>
 I think you're really gonna like this.<br/>
<br/>
 From now on, you are mine.<br/>
<br/>
 Aah!<br/>
<br/>
 Can I make the call now?<br/>
<br/>
 Gotta make it look real.<br/>
<br/>
 Do it quick before you pass out.<br/>
<br/>
 And?<br/>
<br/>
 What if I told you, you could turn this piece of crap into four grand for each of us, minimum?<br/>
<br/>
 This little fella he's called the Merry Wanderer.<br/>
<br/>
 He's not much to look at.<br/>
<br/>
 He's pretty easy to find.<br/>
<br/>
 I got this one at a pawn shop on 4th for 20 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 But he has a cousin called Bavarian Boy, almost identical same umbrella, same swagger.<br/>
<br/>
 That one is worth a boatload.<br/>
<br/>
 And I gather you know where to find a Bavarian Boy.<br/>
<br/>
 I do, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
 He's gathering dust on a shelf in an office up on San Mateo, and he's been there for God knows how long.<br/>
<br/>
 And they have no idea what they've got.<br/>
<br/>
 To them, it's not Bavarian Boy.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just "some piece of junk grandma gave me that I feel too guilty to get rid of.<br/>
<br/>
 " And that's where you come in.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, this place I'm talking about they're not exactly what you call security-conscious.<br/>
<br/>
 There's no cameras whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
 There's an alarm on the door that I could probably bridge.<br/>
<br/>
 And past that, you just pick a lock and walk over to the shelf and swap this Wanderer for that Boy, and it's five minutes, max.<br/>
<br/>
 Warm-up, gentlemen?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks, Fran.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 That's cute.<br/>
<br/>
 - Isn't it, though?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Have your food up in a jiff, Mike.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, they're not even gonna know it's gone.<br/>
<br/>
 They look over at the shelf, they just see the same dumb tchotchkes staring at them they've been looking at for years.<br/>
<br/>
 There's no serial number.<br/>
<br/>
 These things are practically untraceable.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, you send Pryce or some other schlub down to Dallas next week.<br/>
<br/>
 They're having a collectibles expo.<br/>
<br/>
 Those people are hungry for Hummels.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, their eyes are gonna pop when they see what we brung 'em.<br/>
<br/>
 And they will pay through the nose, which we will split fifty-fifty.<br/>
<br/>
 So, it's perfect, right?<br/>
<br/>
 We make some nice Hummel-loving lady happy, and we make a bundle.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's do something beautiful here.<br/>
<br/>
 And how did you come across this valuable wunderkind?<br/>
<br/>
 What difference does it make?<br/>
<br/>
 Guys in the office cross you?<br/>
<br/>
 Done you wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 You're, uh, missing the point.<br/>
<br/>
 It's free money.<br/>
<br/>
 You walk by a $20 on the sidewalk?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 You pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
 Pass.<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 It's not for me.<br/>
<br/>
 Not for you?<br/>
<br/>
 Is there some problem I'm not seeing, like with the swap or something?<br/>
<br/>
 Plan's fine, as far as it goes.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just not for me.<br/>
<br/>
 And I don't think it should be for you, either.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry about your brother.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 But you're really not gonna do this?<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 - Eggs easy.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks, Fran.<br/>
<br/>
 Can I get you anything else?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure I can't get you anything?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 I, um If you don't want easy money, that's your business.<br/>
<br/>
 I just thought I'd give you first crack at a golden opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll see you around.<br/>
<br/>
 You take it easy.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 I was wondering if Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Caldera had any openings today.<br/>
<br/>
 As soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
 I have a very sick fish.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 And, uh, thanks again for the lift.<br/>
<br/>
 It's outside your job description, I know.<br/>
<br/>
 It's no problem.<br/>
<br/>
 So, the acquisitions?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll need to draft contracts for the target banks.<br/>
<br/>
 The idea is to have the agreements ready to go while we're doing due diligence.<br/>
<br/>
 You want me to start cracking on a draft when we're done here?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 But thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll do the first pass, and then you can proof it.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 Whatever's best for you.<br/>
<br/>
 Here's what I'm thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 Looking at the competition, one opportunity stands out.<br/>
<br/>
 They don't have the market share, but and this is a big deal Walker Ridge is eager.<br/>
<br/>
 I agree.<br/>
<br/>
 They took a hit in the market adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
 They're vulnerable, and they know it.<br/>
<br/>
 I think we should prepare a package for both with that in mind Is that Kim Wexler I hear?<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin.<br/>
<br/>
 It's good to see you.<br/>
<br/>
 I heard you were here, just wanted to say hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Look at you.<br/>
<br/>
 Baby bird with a broken wing.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, it's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn't even hurt.<br/>
<br/>
 Just a pain in the butt.<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin, this is Viola Goto, my new paralegal.<br/>
<br/>
 Viola.<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin Wachtell.<br/>
<br/>
 Welcome to the team.<br/>
<br/>
 Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, Kim, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about Charles McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 It's no secret I had problems with the man, but, uh, no one should go like that.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, I just have to ask how's James handling it?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, he's - he's getting through it.<br/>
<br/>
 He and the family really appreciated the arrangement you sent for the funeral.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, glad to hear it.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Kevin, you remember we're meeting the board at noon to go over Kim's recommendations, so No, no, no, I won't slow you down.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, uh, one more thing and this will just take a second Kim, you have got to see the models.<br/>
<br/>
 The models?<br/>
<br/>
 Takes your breath away, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
 Look at this.<br/>
<br/>
 The whole side of this building is glass, and it's on a north-facing lot.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm told that's energy-efficient, so I'm excited about that.<br/>
<br/>
 This is, uh, Salt Lake City?<br/>
<br/>
 After Provo, why not?<br/>
<br/>
 And - Cheyenne, Wyoming?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 Over here, North Platte, Nebraska.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, these two you already know.<br/>
<br/>
 This one's gonna be Ogden, Utah, and this one here is Tucumcari.<br/>
<br/>
 And over here on this side, you got a few new ones Sedona, Pueblo, Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
 And you know what?<br/>
<br/>
 That's just the tip of the iceberg.<br/>
<br/>
 After that, I figure why not Las Vegas?<br/>
<br/>
 Nevada, I mean.<br/>
<br/>
 Reno, too.<br/>
<br/>
 Lubbock, Texas, Amarillo, San Antonio, El Paso.<br/>
<br/>
 Then we're gonna get up to the Pacific Northwest Boise, Bend, Oregon, Eugene, Salem, all the way up to Portland.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, this one is real special Denver.<br/>
<br/>
 See here?<br/>
<br/>
 We're gonna go ahead and add more trees on the west side, and that'll be great, and then maybe a a bench or two on the outside.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim, is there something wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No, no.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just It's a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a very fast, aggressive expansion.<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin figures once we get our foothold in Utah, then we'll file for federal charter.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 We're really building something here.<br/>
<br/>
 All your hard work is making a difference.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, Kim, this is what it's all about.<br/>
<br/>
 So, I can get the notes to you by EOD, if that's okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, yeah, that's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have a sense when I should expect your draft?<br/>
<br/>
 I assume you're dictating it.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, you were right before.<br/>
<br/>
 Why don't you take a s*ab at it, and then I'll take a look?<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 That works.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll start on that right after I get you home.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, instead of taking me home, drop me off at the courthouse, would you?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I didn't realize you had an appearance today.<br/>
<br/>
 - I would have prepped.<br/>
<br/>
 - No.<br/>
<br/>
 No, I don't.<br/>
<br/>
 - You don't?<br/>
<br/>
 - Nothing to prep.<br/>
<br/>
 Don't worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No, not the dog.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I've done business with him before, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Once.<br/>
<br/>
 Once.<br/>
<br/>
 Just the once.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 - He didn't say.<br/>
<br/>
 - Well?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 He's not into it.<br/>
<br/>
 He's not into it, or you're not into it?<br/>
<br/>
 - Give me that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Unh-unh.<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn't work that way.<br/>
<br/>
 No direct contact.<br/>
<br/>
 That's the point.<br/>
<br/>
 Just give it to me.<br/>
<br/>
 Take it.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the interested party.<br/>
<br/>
 I have one question for you.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you shit gold?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, it's a simple yes or no.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you shit gold?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
 Because unless you currently have a large gold nugget traversing your colon, this is the easiest money you're ever gonna make.<br/>
<br/>
 How long does it take for you to pick a Yale three-pin?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, then in 8 minutes, you're gonna make 4 grand, 10 minutes if you decide to pick your nose.<br/>
<br/>
 In, out, no one comes looking for you ever.<br/>
<br/>
 How does that sound?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I know where that is.<br/>
<br/>
 Here.<br/>
<br/>
 Pen.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
 In a half an hour.<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 See, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, but All right, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill, you're all set.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
 See ya next time.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope she feels better soon.<br/>
<br/>
 Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
 Can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
 Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, not here.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me go grab my bag and tell my staff.<br/>
<br/>
 Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
 Can you not hit every damn pothole, please?!<br/>
<br/>
 Careful.<br/>
<br/>
 Careful!<br/>
<br/>
 Up, up.<br/>
<br/>
 You, ayuda.<br/>
<br/>
 Come here.<br/>
<br/>
 Help.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, well, there he is.<br/>
<br/>
 You woke up.<br/>
<br/>
 That means my Spanish is good enough and Yul Brynner over here is actually O-negative.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I had to leave a b*llet in your shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
 Might set off metal detectors from now on.<br/>
<br/>
 Gave ya a dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
 Pulse is good.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, sniff test says you probably didn't perforate your bowel probably.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't be 100 percent sure you didn't get nicked.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, if this starts to leak, you're gonna get the worst infection of your life.<br/>
<br/>
 It's gonna hurt like hell, and then you're gonna die.<br/>
<br/>
 So I advise you to go see a doctor that has some imaging tech in other words, one that's not working out of the back of a Jiffy Lube.<br/>
<br/>
 Till then, keep these clean and dry, change the bandages daily you should be okay.<br/>
<br/>
 You understand me?<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, understand this.<br/>
<br/>
 After I walk out of here, I never want to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
 Never.<br/>
<br/>
 This cartel shit is too hot for me.<br/>
<br/>
 You got it?<br/>
<br/>
 It's me.<br/>
<br/>
 Can we talk, please?<br/>
<br/>
 I-I just want to come home.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I just wanted to say I'm sorry if you feel upset.<br/>
<br/>
 It was not my intention f-for you to feel upset.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, m-my intention was for Honey, it is top-of-the-line.<br/>
<br/>
 Then what is the point?<br/>
<br/>
 You're saying I'm a I'm a thoughtless that I don't care, but it is a very, very expensive vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
 It It never loses suction!<br/>
<br/>
 So, what you're saying is I've got I got to sleep in my office because I got you a gift?!<br/>
<br/>
 Lynette?<br/>
<br/>
 Lynette?<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you still delivering?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, yeah, just a large cheese.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Sliced, please.<br/>
<br/>
 Could you also throw in some dipping sticks?<br/>
<br/>
 Two ranch and one marinara.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 How'd it go?<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Listen.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen.<br/>
<br/>
 - I was - Look.<br/>
<br/>
 - The office guy he's here.<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 He's dug in for the night, man.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 You too.<br/>
<br/>
 - Come get me or Come get me!<br/>
<br/>
 Now, if you'll take out the little listener's guide that came with the program, you'll see a chart in there showing four quadrants I call the Time Management Matrix.<br/>
<br/>
 The key words to understand are "importance" and "urgency.<br/>
<br/>
 " Importance basically comes from within you.<br/>
<br/>
 Importance is your value system, hopefully based on principles.<br/>
<br/>
 Importance is your mission Importance - your central strategy - versus to accomplish those high-priority goals urgency.<br/>
<br/>
 and the plan to implement that strategy.<br/>
<br/>
 Urgency comes from the environment it presses upon you.<br/>
<br/>
 Its proximate is right in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
 And it's often very popular.<br/>
<br/>
 I could be deep and Son of a b*tch.<br/>
<br/>
 it's urgent, - it has the appearance - Oh, God.<br/>
<br/>
 of requiring immediate attention.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, you have to decide what is truly important in your life.<br/>
<br/>
 That's why I Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 Stop!<br/>
<br/>
 Stop!<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no!<br/>
<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>
<div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="display:inline-block"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 Stop!<br/>
<br/>
 No, stop!<br/>
<br/>
 Stop!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 So, did you get it?<br/>
<br/>
 sh1tting gold.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, right?<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't say it was easy.<br/>
<br/>
 Car thing was pretty slick.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know how you pulled that off.<br/>
<br/>
 Worked, though, didn't it?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess so.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes?<br/>
<br/>
 The Salamancas were hit.<br/>
<br/>
 Yesterday, on the way back from their pickup.<br/>
<br/>
 Do we know who?<br/>
<br/>
 Not yet.<br/>
<br/>
 Varga survived barely, but he couldn't see faces.<br/>
<br/>
 - Someone knows our business.<br/>
<br/>
 - Possibly.<br/>
<br/>
 It resembled the attack on Hector's truck a few months ago, and they knew the Salamanca men were heavy.<br/>
<br/>
 Don Juan, we are about to run another shipment.<br/>
<br/>
 If you think we're compromised Run dummy loads.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll see what we see.<br/>
<br/>
 No product crosses until we're certain.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
 How long before our dealers run dry?<br/>
<br/>
 No more than a week.<br/>
<br/>
 This is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
 Find a local supplier on your side of the border.<br/>
<br/>
 Cut a deal.<br/>
<br/>
 Don Juan, with all due respect, Don Eladio forbids buying from outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
 He's been very clear.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me worry about Eladio.<br/>
<br/>
 Do it now.<br/>
<br/>
 There's antimony, arsenic, aluminum, selenium And hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium And nickel, neodymium, neptunium, germanium And iron, americium, ruthenium, uranium Europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium And lanthanum and osmium and astatine and radium And gold and protactinium and indium and gallium And iodine and thorium and thulium and thallium There's yttrium, ytterbium, actinium, rubidium And boron, gadolinium, niobium, iridium There's strontium and silicon and silver and samarium And bismuth, bromine, lithium, beryllium, and barium Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 I wasn't expecting you.<br/>
<br/>
 That's not a problem, I hope.<br/>
<br/>
 No, not at all.<br/>
<br/>
 I was tinkering with something.<br/>
<br/>
 What's that?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, it's, uh, technical.<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn't want to bore you.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, you wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 You know when you put salt into water, it dissolves?<br/>
<br/>
 If you stir the water or heat it, you can add more salt than you could otherwise before it falls out of solution.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm trying to create a solution like that, but with certain benzodiazepine precursor compounds.<br/>
<br/>
 That's fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
 It will be if I can get it to work.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I tested your samples.<br/>
<br/>
 They range from 39 percent to 58 percent pure, except this one, which hovers around 67.<br/>
<br/>
 Top of the class, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
 You should tell the chemist to check his or her cookware.<br/>
<br/>
 It's introducing contamination, which would be easy to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, thank you very much, Gale.<br/>
<br/>
 That's very useful information.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I should let you get back to your work.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring, um, I-I don't want to cast aspersions, but I have to tell you, these samples aren't great.<br/>
<br/>
 I-In fact, they're, um they're they're not even good.<br/>
<br/>
 Basically, they're dreck.<br/>
<br/>
 I could do much better - Gale - much higher-grade.<br/>
<br/>
 I could make a kilo or more right here, and no one would know.<br/>
<br/>
 Wouldn't take more than a few days.<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn't want to interfere with your studies.<br/>
<br/>
 These are my studies.<br/>
<br/>
 Please.<br/>
<br/>
 It's the least I can do.<br/>
<br/>
 I wouldn't let you down.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm certain that you wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
 But I'm afraid I can't allow it not yet.<br/>
<br/>
 You were meant for better things.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll see you soon, Gale.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 There's holmium and helium and hafnium and erbium And phosphorus and francium and fluorine and terbium And manganese and mercury, molybdenum, magnesium, Dysprosium and scandium and cerium and cesium And lead, praseodymium and platinum, plutonium, Palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium Tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium And cadmium and calcium and chromium and curium Oh, I was worried about the wording there.<br/>
<br/>
 Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
 No, no.<br/>
<br/>
 It's great.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Really, really solid work.<br/>
<br/>
 Just make the change to indicate the correct term for the disbursement of funds, and then we should be good to go.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Don't mind me.<br/>
<br/>
 I know it's a law office.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just walking around your law office.<br/>
<br/>
 You slept late.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 It took me awhile to fall asleep, actually, but, man, once I did, I Uh, you want some coffee, Viola?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 We're just finishing up.<br/>
<br/>
 Unless there's something else you need from me.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I think we're good.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe, uh, you could also start looking into federal charter regs.<br/>
<br/>
 No rush.<br/>
<br/>
 Got it.<br/>
<br/>
 Will do.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 See ya, Viola.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

 "Dear Jimmy, I have left many things unsaid in our relationship through the years.<br/>
<br/>
 Rather than all allow allow these unspoken thoughts to die with me, I've chosen to record them here for you.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope you will take my words in the spirit in which they are intended.<br/>
<br/>
 " New paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
 "I remember quite clearly the day you came home from the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't imagine the joy on Mom's face.<br/>
<br/>
 I can honestly say I never saw her happier than she was on that day.<br/>
<br/>
 You brought a shine to her life that nothing else ever did, and I'm glad of that.<br/>
<br/>
 " New paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
 "We have not always seen eye to eye.<br/>
<br/>
 I expect that will continue to be so in the future.<br/>
<br/>
 However, nothing will ever change the fact that we are brothers, flesh and blood.<br/>
<br/>
 And though we are very different people, I want you to know how much I respect what you have made of yourself in these last few years.<br/>
<br/>
 You have taken the opportunity I gave you in the mailroom, and you have run with it, becoming a valued member of the HHM family.<br/>
<br/>
 For all the problems in your past, I'm proud we share the name McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 " "I sincerely admire your energy and resilience.<br/>
<br/>
 I used to worry about you finding a place in the world, but I'm not worried about that anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm certain now that, no matter what the future may bring, you'll land on your feet, and I hope when you read this, you remember me not only as your brother, but as a person you knew was always in your corner.<br/>
<br/>
