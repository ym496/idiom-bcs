This requires a proper celebration, so don't think that this counts.<br/>

This is perfect.<br/>

Besides... we're pinching pennies now.<br/>

When we have a steady revenue stream, make the drive up to Geronimo every night.<br/>

Till then...<br/>

Yes. That.<br/>

Let's make that happen.<br/>

Okay, here's what ya gotta do.<br/>

Type up your resignation letter now...<br/>

<br/>
Yeah.<br/>

Well, I mean, finish your hot dog first, but...<br/>

Now, you put that letter into Howard's office tonight.<br/>
<br/>
It's on his premises.<br/>
<br/>
You've officially given notice.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning, while he's still out on the back nine chasin' his balls, you call Mesa Verde and your other clients, you bring 'em along.<br/>
<br/>
You get to them before he does.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
What? No.<br/>
<br/>
You gotta act now.<br/>
<br/>
Listen, you do this the "right way," you wait, you tell Howard to his face, he'll sink his dirty hooks into Mesa Verde before you get the words "I quit" outta your mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Jimmy, I appreciate the advice, but the whole point of this is for you to be your kind of lawyer and me to be mine.<br/>
<br/>
I need to find a way to do this that's right for me.<br/>

I only need a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Howard</strong>: Great. What's up?<br/>
<br/>
Howard, could we do this in your office?<br/>
<br/>
Please?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for taking the time.<br/>
<br/>
You can just... go ahead and rip off the Band-Aid.<br/>
<br/>
I have a pretty good idea why you're here.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
So, you're going with Schweikart and Cokely.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry?<br/>
<br/>
I heard.<br/>
<br/>
Through the grapevine.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to another firm.<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting my own.<br/>
<br/>
I figured I'd try giving it a go as a solo practitioner.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Well.<br/>
<br/>
I, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
I realized it was something I needed to do.<br/>
<br/>
The week Jimmy exits Davis &amp; Main, you decide to leave us?<br/>
<br/>
That can't just be happenstance.<br/>

It's not.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna be sharing expenses.<br/>
<br/>
One office, but two separate practices.<br/>
<br/>
Smart... on several counts.<br/>
<br/>
Howard...<br/>
<br/>
I want you to know that I appreciate my time here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm grateful for everything you and the firm have done for me, especially the financial help with my schooling, and I'm ready to write a check for the remainder of the loan.<br/>
<br/>
I just need accounting to get me that figure.<br/>
<br/>
No need. Our gift to you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
Um... thank you.<br/>
<br/>
You earned it.<br/>
<br/>
Tell you the truth, I'm kinda envious.<br/>
<br/>
Really? Why?<br/>
<br/>
Something about a fresh start.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the day, right out of law school, I thought long and hard about hanging up my own shingle.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I was ready to take on the world, make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Dad talked me out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Wanted me to join the ranks here, throw another "H" in the firm's logo.<br/>
<br/>
Things work out the way they're supposed to, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Kim, I want you to know that I always pushed you harder because I knew that I could expect more from you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you.<br/>

I am not the safe choice.<br/>

The safe choice for you would be HHM.<br/>
<br/>
I believe, however, that I am... the right choice.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
That suit you're wearing... did you buy it off the rack?<br/>
<br/>
Please don't tell me it<em class="text-italics"> looks</em> like I did.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.<br/>
<br/>
So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?<br/>
<br/>
[Scott Fisher's<em class="text-italics"> "Samba Das Tes Bras AML"</em> plays in background]<br/>
<br/>
Because it fits you and you alone.<br/>
<br/>
Because each and every stitch was fretted over with you in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Either you fit the jacket... or the jacket fits you.<br/>
<br/>
What if I want a whole warehouse full of suits?<br/>
<br/>
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.<br/>
<br/>
How's one single tailor gonna get that job done?<br/>
<br/>
I know your bank's needs in regard to this expansion inside and out.<br/>
<br/>
Having Mesa Verde as my sole client will take up the entirety of my attention, to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
But if this were beyond my abilities, I wouldn't be throwing my hat in the ring.<br/>

Perfect timing. I was just getting the tour.<br/>

Kim, this is Steve.<br/>

Hi.<br/>

Steve's the agent for the place.<br/>
<br/>
Hi. Kim.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to meet ya.<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Kim. Everything okay?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, uh... wow.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I, uh...<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a... it's a dentist's office.<br/>
<br/>
Two offices for two dentists, each the exact same size with a mirrored layout.<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
The other one is the next door over, right beside this one.<br/>

Right here.<br/>
<br/>
But they share one lobby, one reception area, so egalitarian as hell.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention efficient.<br/>

Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, also... soundproof walls, what with the drilling and the pain and the whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
And the location, I mean, holy crap.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the place. [Sighs]<br/>

Kim?<br/>

You got Mesa Verde?<br/>
<br/>
Yes!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, there's nothing in writing yet, but the lunch went... [stammers]<br/>
<br/>
It kicked ass.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
It was a little touch-and-go there for a moment, I'll admit, but Paige pitched in, and she really talked me up.<br/>
<br/>
And then once that door cracked open...<br/>
<br/>
High five. Fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I-I had an for answer question, every concern, and I did not bad-mouth HHM, not at all, but I was, like, enthusiasm, you know, and personal service, because that's gotta count for something.<br/>
<br/>
Shit, yeah, that counts!<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, 'cause, like, why were they even at HHM in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
Me. So, uh... Oh, and then when we walked out of the restaurant, when Kevin wasn't looking, Paige gives me a thumbs-up.<br/>

It's likely that we're losing Mesa Verde.<br/>

<br/>
Mnh. Not another firm.<br/>

She's going into private practice.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, that's completely...<br/>

<br/>
<em class="text-italics">Why</em> is she going out on her own?<br/>

Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you both for coming.<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not here to extol the virtues of HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Mm. I'm guessing you've already had to suffer through Howard's hard sell first time around, so [Chuckles] you've done your time, as far as I'm concerned.<br/>
<br/>
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
I gave them cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Cookies<em class="text-italics"> were</em> good, as I recall.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.<br/>
<br/>
Kim Wexler is, indeed, the right choice to handle Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
She's the obvious choice.<br/>
<br/>
She's young, she's brilliant, she's going places.<br/>
<br/>
Let's face it, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
She's the future.<br/>
<br/>
Two old guys like us, we're the past.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's a sad thought.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Sad but true.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Banking law... needs to be exciting.<br/>
<br/>
It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.<br/>
<br/>
Really wake it up.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell ya how boring<em class="text-italics"> I</em> am.<br/>
<br/>
I read FEC and ISO reports for entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
He does. I can attest to that.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I try to stay up on things.<br/>
<br/>
The rules are changing all the time.<br/>
<br/>
With everything that's happened with Enron and WorldCom, the government is extra vigilant.<br/>
<br/>
These days, the penalties for even the most honest of errors can be devastating.<br/>
<br/>
You need a sharp, young eye to catch that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, when you've specialized in this kind of work for decades on end, you tend to get kinda...<br/>
<br/>
Stale.<br/>
<br/>
Stale.<br/>
<br/>
You get stale.<br/>
<br/>
You forget about things like, oh, I don't know, the Community Reinvestment Act.<br/>
<br/>
Any bank such as Mesa Verde looking to open a<em class="text-italics"> de novo</em> branch is definitely going to need to show a healthy portfolio of CRA compliance.<br/>
<br/>
Duh. [Chuckles] Obviously.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have all that covered, I'm sure.<br/>
<br/>
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act... there's another mouthful, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Boring!<br/>
<br/>
Still, if you were to run afoul of it, it could hold you up in court for years.<br/>
<br/>
And by the way, uh, if that <em class="text-italics">were</em> to happen to you folks as you go forward without us, which it will not, um, Howard has contacts at the Fed who could help sort things out.<br/>
<br/>
One or two. Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
And then there's the SEC's interpretation of Section 302 of Sarbox.<br/>
<br/>
Blah, blah, blah. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, navigating that correctly could mean savings of several hundred thousand dollars.<br/>
<br/>
They know that, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
When you reach your golden years, you tend to get a little long-winded, ramble on and on about details.<br/>
<br/>
My point being, your bank is in excellent hands.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I take your point. I do.<br/>
<br/>
But I have to say, I have complete confidence in Ms. Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
You should.<br/>
<br/>
She was part of our team.<br/>
<br/>
She learned from us.<br/>
<br/>
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter how talented one individual may be, the needs of Mesa Verde are too big to handle alone.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't handle your coming expansion alone.<br/>
<br/>
Which is why you should consider, once again, enlisting a team of professionals.<br/>
<br/>
Glad we did this.<br/>
<br/>
Any time.<br/>
<br/>
We are there for you day and night.<br/>
<br/>
Lovely to meet you, Paige.<br/>
<br/>
And you. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Talk soon, gentlemen.<br/>

You doing okay? You need some water?<br/>
<br/>
[Mutters indistinctly]<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, nuts. I forgot his water.<br/>
<br/>
[Coughing] Oh, hey. I can run back to the office, get him a bottle.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: You could?<br/>
<br/>
Fudge, the captain's gonna run back to his office, get you some water, okay, sir?<br/>
<br/>
[Groans]<br/>
<br/>
All right. That's great.<br/>
<br/>
And there's no rush. He's gonna be fine.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be back ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Up. Up.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I told you not to say anything.<br/>
<br/>
Go stand by the front, uh, those nose, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Where the hell'd you find this guy?<br/>
<br/>
You couldn't get a real w*r hero?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, like they grow on trees. So, this guy owes me.<br/>
<br/>
I defended him a while back when he couldn't pay.<br/>
<br/>
Defended him for what?<br/>
<br/>
What? You wanna be a lawyer when you grow up?<br/>
<br/>
Just fix the...<br/>
<br/>
Public masturbation.<br/>
<br/>
Total bullshit.<br/>

All right, keep your voice down.<br/>

You're part of the greatest generation.<br/>
<br/>
You fought the Nazis.<br/>
<br/>
Fought the Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
Fought Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
I fought the Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
This machine was used in the Pacific, where the Japanese are.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you shut up and learn to take some direction?<br/>
<br/>
Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
All right, fine.<br/>
<br/>
You fought all the dirty... Axis powers.<br/>
<br/>
Your band of brothers came together, and you saved the world.<br/>
<br/>
You're heroic.<br/>
<br/>
Not that heroic.<br/>
<br/>
Just throw it away a little more.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, good.<br/>

Fudge.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Ernesto</strong>: Jimmy, man, I'm at your brother's, and he's bad.<br/>
<br/>
Bad? How bad?<br/>
<br/>
He's... I don't know. Bad, shakin'.<br/>
<br/>
I've never seen him like this.<br/>
<br/>
He keeps telling me not to call a doctor.<br/>
<br/>
Lemme guess.<br/>
<br/>
He's been going into the office.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, more and more.<br/>
<br/>
He had a big meeting there today.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.<br/>
<br/>
Wrap him in a space blanket.<br/>
<br/>
He's already under one.<br/>
<br/>
Wrap him in a second one.<br/>
<br/>
Make him some tea, or just, better, heat some chicken broth.<br/>
<br/>
Just let it simmer.<br/>
<br/>
Don't make it boil.<br/>
<br/>
That's it? No doctor?<br/>
<br/>
That's it. No doctor. He's just gotta ride this out.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
Oh sh... I gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
Rhubarb. Rhubarb!<br/>
<br/>
Idiots, that's the signal.<br/>
<br/>
Get him in the chair.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
[Grunts]<br/>
<br/>
Where's the air hose? Stick it in your nose.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Sir!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, this is not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Would you mind if the guys and I took a picture with you?<br/>
<br/>
It would mean a lot to us.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, uh, p-pictures. He loves pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Here. Give me the camera.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's your water.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

I lost Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
I had him.<br/>
<br/>
I<em class="text-italics"> thought</em> I had him.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
So what happened?<br/>
<br/>
They're s-sticking with HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Paige said they went over there this afternoon for some kind of... courtesy meeting, or so she thought, and Kevin got his head turned.<br/>
<br/>
By Howard?<br/>

Jimmy, I have to ask.<br/>
<br/>
You still up for doing this?<br/>
<br/>
What? You mean getting the office?<br/>
<br/>
All of it.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe we need to... slow down and really, you know... think about this.<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing's changed.<br/>
<br/>
N-nothing's changed?<br/>
<br/>
We're about to sign a very expensive lease after a very sizable chunk of income just went flying out the window.<br/>
<br/>
That's why we're a team.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Something like this happens... you're there to help me, I'm there to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
There will be other Mesa Verdes.<br/>

You did good, Ernie.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you, uh, go home and get some sleep?<br/>
<br/>
I'll take over.<br/>
<br/>
He told me he wanted me to stay.<br/>

It's okay. I'm here now.<br/>

Is it afternoon?<br/>
<br/>
Where's Ernesto?<br/>

He was supposed to stay with me.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get mad at Ernie.<br/>
<br/>
He spent the better part of a day watching you do your impression of a baked potato.<br/>

I told him to go home, get some shut eye.<br/>

You had to swipe it from her.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't swipe anything.<br/>

[Drill whirring]<br/>
<br/>
You're doing a great job.<br/>
<br/>
You done this before?<br/>
<br/>
No, not like this, but we learned about fractions in school.<br/>
<br/>
You did? What fractions?<br/>
<br/>
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I gotta tell ya, you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.<br/>

Maybe you needed better teachers.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Kaylee</strong>: We're making a special hose.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.<br/>
<br/>
I made marks every 3/4 inch, then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down so he doesn't ruin his table.<br/>
<br/>
Then we line up a drill, put the hole on the "X."<br/>
<br/>
Huh. Wow.<br/>
<br/>
I needed a soaker for the rhododendrons out back.<br/>
