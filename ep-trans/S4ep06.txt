<br/>
 It's impossible?<br/>

<br/>
 Isaacson.<br/>
<br/>
 - The case.<br/>
<br/>
 - I don't Isaacson vs.<br/>
<br/>
 Vakarian Holdings, Inc.<br/>
<br/>
 We've been assembling binders for months.<br/>
<br/>
 I've been kind of slammed with the Oscar pool, in case you weren't paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll try harder.<br/>
<br/>
 So, this guy, Isaacson he dies of a heart attack.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 - And his family they're our clients sort through his financials, you know, looking to track down his assets.<br/>
<br/>
 Lo and behold, they find some old shares in this company he invested in like 20 years back.<br/>
<br/>
 Family tracks down the CFO, looking to cash out, but he tells them, "Hmm, that corporation's been dissolved.<br/>
<br/>
 " Isaacson's shares are worthless.<br/>
<br/>
 - Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
 - Right?<br/>
<br/>
 But Chuck does some digging, and it turns out they formed a new corporation that's virtually identical to the old corp Isaacson invested in.<br/>
<br/>
 It's the same officers, same structure, everything.<br/>
<br/>
 - Ah.<br/>
<br/>
 - Right?<br/>
<br/>
 So, Chuck finds exemption 4 in Leannais vs.<br/>
<br/>
 Cincinnati, - which is compl - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, listen.<br/>
<br/>
 I appreciate the effort, but can you just big-picture it for me?<br/>
<br/>
 I am.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck won a case that Howard thought was unwinnable using only the power of obscure case law.<br/>
<br/>
 - [CHUCKLES]<br/>
<br/>
 - That's good.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, very.<br/>

 I just wanted to ask.<br/>
<br/>
 Vakarian Holdings, Inc.<br/>
<br/>
 , would have been liable under the "continuing enterprise" exception, <br/>
<br/>
 - as well, right?<br/>
<br/>
 - That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, we looked into that.<br/>
<br/>
 [SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
 What was the case law on that?<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh, Garcia vs.<br/>
<br/>
 Coe Manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 Sounds like it was Isaacson v.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck handing him his butt on a platter, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, yeah, but Isaacson is our client.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, really?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, the the other guys' butts, then.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, served on platters.<br/>

 Outside, too, obviously, in case someone tries to find a way in or out.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll put a sally port on that door.<br/>

 We'll control it from the outside.<br/>

 And we're gonna need a trailer to monitor the cameras.<br/>

 Close by.<br/>

 2 guys, 24-hour monitoring, working shifts.<br/>

 [BREATHES DEEPLY]<br/>
<br/>
 I grew up quite poor.<br/>
<br/>
 We lived in the hills, in a place my brothers built from things they found metal sheeting, plywood.<br/>
<br/>
 When it rained, it smelled like hay.<br/>
<br/>
 We were always hungry.<br/>
<br/>
 But there was a lucuma tree, scrawny, barely alive.<br/>
<br/>
 My family had given up on it years before.<br/>
<br/>
 Never bore fruit.<br/>
<br/>
 When I was 7, I became fixated on it.<br/>
<br/>
 I watered it, tended to it.<br/>
<br/>
 It took a long time, but the buds grew into green fruit.<br/>
<br/>
 I was so proud.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't tell anyone.<br/>
<br/>
 I plucked one and hid behind our shack.<br/>
<br/>
 I ate the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd never tasted something so sweet.<br/>
<br/>
 It was like caramel.<br/>
<br/>
 At first, we ate the fruit ourselves, and then I began taking it to the village to sell.<br/>
<br/>
 [TELEPHONE RINGS IN DISTANCE]<br/>
<br/>
 One day, much of the fruit was gone from my tree.<br/>
<br/>
 [BEEPING, HISSING CONTINUES]<br/>
<br/>
 Piece were scattered on the ground, half-eaten.<br/>
<br/>
 I thought it was probably a coati.<br/>

 I built a snare using branches and wire.<br/>
<br/>
 It didn't take long for the animal to set it off.<br/>
<br/>
 But the coati thrashed so hard, it broke out of the snare broke its leg, as well.<br/>
<br/>
 I tried to grab it, but it slipped away.<br/>
<br/>
 It ran under the house.<br/>
<br/>
 I knew it would show itself sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
 So I waited for hours, into the night.<br/>
<br/>
 When my brothers called for me I did not answer.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't make a sound.<br/>
<br/>
 I was so still.<br/>
<br/>
 Finally, it came out.<br/>
<br/>
 It knew I was there, but it was hungry.<br/>
