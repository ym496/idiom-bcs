Don't worry about that, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Look down. Look at the grass.<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCK SIGHING]<br/>
<br/>
Kick off your shoes like this.<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time you did that?<br/>
<br/>
Feels good, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Grass between your toes.<br/>
<br/>
Feels nice.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think maybe... Maybe it's time we go in.<br/>
<br/>
We got a lot of work to do. We need to get ready.<br/>
<br/>
You need to get ready.<br/>
<br/>
If I were Schweikart and Cokely, I'd seek a restraining order.<br/>
<br/>
Turn this into a civil harassment issue.<br/>
<br/>
Schweikart and Cokely can come after me with a restraining order or anything else they got.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be ready.<br/>
<br/>
Confidence is good.<br/>
<br/>
Facts on your side, better.<br/>
<br/>
Know what you're walking into.<br/>

[BOTH CHUCKLE]<br/>
<br/>
[GIGGLING]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Mike</strong>: I got her all her sh*ts.<br/>
<br/>
Healthy gums. And no worms. No fleas.<br/>
<br/>
I promise you, if the little sucker has fleas, I'll kick her butt myself.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's just a dog...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, it's good to have a dog around.<br/>
<br/>
Bad guys think twice about breaking into a house with a dog.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Stacey</strong>: Yeah, I bet that one's gonna keep a lot of burglars away.<br/>
<br/>
It's just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
You know, you can always keep her over at my place.<br/>
<br/>
Kaylee can visit her any time she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you decide to keep her, I got a giant bag of puppy chow out in the car for you.<br/>
<br/>
All the supplies. Everything you need.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kaylee</strong>: Aw... What's that?<br/>
<br/>
The dog can stay here.<br/>
<br/>
You sure?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Done.<br/>
<br/>
[CELL PHONE RINGING]<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me a minute.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Got it.<br/>
<br/>
Is everything okay?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Just a lead on a job opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Your Honor, Mr. Schweikart and his cohorts are attempting to keep me away from their victims.<br/>
<br/>
Victims? My clients. Yes.<br/>
<br/>
You're denying me access.<br/>
<br/>
Even the worst prisoners in this building are allowed access to a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying my poor, elderly clients have fewer rights than jail inmates?<br/>
<br/>
Not at all, and no one is denying Mr. McGill access to his clients.<br/>
<br/>
We're denying access to the property.<br/>
<br/>
It's semantics. Which is well within Sandpiper Crossing's rights. The building is private property.<br/>
<br/>
Paid for by the residents.<br/>
<br/>
But managed by licensed professionals.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. One at a time, gentlemen.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Schweikart, you're denying him access on what grounds?<br/>
<br/>
These assisted living residents have a daily routine that they're used to.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McGill, who is loud and flamboyant, is a disturbance to these routines.<br/>
<br/>
Residents who want to see a lawyer, free to leave whenever they want.<br/>
<br/>
Leave whenever they want?<br/>
<br/>
We're talking about elderly and infirm people here.<br/>
<br/>
The most common phrase in this place?<br/>
<br/>
"I've fallen and I can't get up."<br/>
<br/>
There's phone consultations, mail and messenger services.<br/>
<br/>
There's plenty of other ways to confer with clients.<br/>
<br/>
But for residents who don't want to be afflicted with Mr. McGill's presence, this becomes an issue of civil harassment.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, you are stretching that definition to its limit.<br/>
<br/>
And FYI, old people adore me.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. I've heard enough.<br/>
<br/>
I have enough here to let me rule on this restraining order.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. Don't worry, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
That's not smoke you smell. That's me. Heh, heh.<br/>
<br/>
This mo-fo is on fire.<br/>
<br/>
Your baby bro kicked some Schweikart ass today.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell's all this?<br/>
<br/>
There was a delivery while you were in court.<br/>
<br/>
Schweikart and Cokely sent this? What is it?<br/>
<br/>
The served interrogatories on each class representative.<br/>
<br/>
This box is deposition notices.<br/>
<br/>
Documents calling into question the mental health of many of our elderly clients.<br/>
<br/>
Attempting to stop the class from being certified on the grounds they're not competent.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this is just the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
They're gonna continue this document dump until we're drowning in paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
All right. We can deal with this.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, hey. It's, uh...<br/>
<br/>
It's just paperwork. Right?<br/>
<br/>
It's no big deal. Just hit it head on.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy. Prioritize.<br/>
<br/>
The most important stuff first.<br/>
<br/>
Or is it better to... deal with the easy stuff?<br/>
<br/>
You know, get that off the decks.<br/>
<br/>
You tell me, Chuck. You just point to a box. We can do this.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, we need to talk. Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, won't you? No, I'm good.<br/>
<br/>
I know you're not gonna like what I have to say next.<br/>
<br/>
But facts are facts.<br/>
<br/>
And what we're facing here...<br/>
<br/>
A case this size, it is not a two man job. We need help.<br/>
<br/>
No. And for the good of the clients, we need to refer this case... Don't say it.<br/>
<br/>
Refer it out to HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Damn it, Chuck. No. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
We can do this. We're doing great on our own.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need Hamlin or anyone else. I mean, hey.<br/>
<br/>
We can Erin Brockovich the shit out of this case.<br/>
<br/>
Erin Brockovich didn't do it alone.<br/>
<br/>
She and Ed Masry brought in heavy hitters from Los Angeles to get that case across the goal line.<br/>
<br/>
And that's what we need to do. And there's no shame in that.<br/>
<br/>
This is our case.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's ours.<br/>
<br/>
And the task ahead is monumental.<br/>
<br/>
Could we do it alone?<br/>
<br/>
Could two men alone build the Brooklyn Bridge? Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
But it would take forever.<br/>
<br/>
Just how long do you think the residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?<br/>
<br/>
Referring this case to HHM is for the good of the clients.<br/>
<br/>
That argument you won today against the restraining order, the judge was never gonna grant that.<br/>
<br/>
Schweikart is throwing softballs.<br/>
<br/>
And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be busy swatting them away, we'll never spend time on the actual case.<br/>
<br/>
This case will span years.<br/>
<br/>
And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
We simply don't.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS THEN SCOFFS]<br/>
<br/>
Fine. So?<br/>
<br/>
The case goes to HHM?<br/>
<br/>
Hail Satan. I submit to the dark side.<br/>
<br/>
I'll call Kim and arrange a meeting.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Good, Jimmy. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I know you'll come to see that it's for the best.<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCKLES]<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>

I guess I'll have to get an office right next to yours.<br/>

This the place where we wait? Think so.<br/>
<br/>
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
What'd our guy tell you about the job?<br/>
<br/>
Not much.<br/>
<br/>
It's a protection job. Civilian.<br/>
<br/>
Guy is as green as they come, but we'll be in there to make sure things fly right.<br/>
<br/>
You been doing this long?<br/>
<br/>
I just assume we're all heavy hitters.<br/>
<br/>
And it makes sense. The vet recommends the best of the best.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with some of these ethnic types, blood tends to run a little hotter.<br/>
<br/>
That's just science. Physiology.<br/>
<br/>
There's historical precedent. Know what I'm saying?<br/>
<br/>
So, what you packing?<br/>
<br/>
A pimento. Sorry, what?<br/>
<br/>
Pimento sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCKLES]<br/>
<br/>
That's funny. Pimento.<br/>
<br/>
No, I mean, what are you carrying?<br/>
<br/>
You know, the piece? What's the make?<br/>
<br/>
Pimento is a cheese.<br/>
<br/>
They call it the caviar of the south.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to tell me what you're carrying, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
But you don't have to be a douche about it.<br/>
<br/>
Just told you what I'm carrying.<br/>
<br/>
So you're saying you don't have a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you're saying?<br/>
<br/>
How are you here without a g*n? Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You have a g*n? Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Of course. He's got a g*n.<br/>
<br/>
I got at least two g*ns on me that I'll tell you about.<br/>
<br/>
I go old school with a Wilson Combat 1911.<br/>
<br/>
I got a GL*CK 22 Gen 3.<br/>
<br/>
And those are just the ones I'll tell you about.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what the hell? Really?<br/>
<br/>
How do you not pack a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
[CAR DOOR OPENS]<br/>
<br/>
Hi. Hello. Uh, my name is Price.<br/>
<br/>
Um, actually, that's not my name.<br/>
<br/>
But, uh, I have a nephew named Price.<br/>
<br/>
I've always kind of liked that name.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we're not dealing with names today.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell me or not tell me yours.<br/>
<br/>
Or a fake one is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Um, if I need to talk to you, I'd prefer something other than "Hey, you."<br/>
<br/>
Either way, you all come highly recommended, so thank you.<br/>
<br/>
First order of business, we have a long drive ahead of us.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I have a cooler of water in the car, some soft drinks.<br/>
<br/>
I don't drink coffee, but there is a diner on the corner.<br/>
<br/>
Also a bathroom in there in case you need to go before we go.<br/>
<br/>
Second order. Uh, money.<br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear that the agreed upon fee of $500 per man is... agreed upon.<br/>
<br/>
If that's acceptable... Yeah, I have a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
How about you give me and Man Mountain 750 each?<br/>
<br/>
And send Uncle Fester there home. He's not carrying a g*n.<br/>
<br/>
He's useless.<br/>
<br/>
Is that true? You didn't bring a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think I'd need one.<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCKLES]<br/>
<br/>
It's a protection job.<br/>
<br/>
It's basic common sense that you need a g*n to protect your employer. I mean, duh.<br/>
<br/>
You're dead weight.<br/>
<br/>
He's just a third wheel without a piece.<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you what.<br/>
<br/>
If I need a g*n, I'll use one of his.<br/>
<br/>
Really? One of my g*ns?<br/>
<br/>
How do you picture that happening exactly?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess I'm gonna take it from you.<br/>
<br/>
That... That is just special. Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Take. How are you gonna take one of my g*ns?<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Billy Jackoff.<br/>
<br/>
Take my g*n from me.<br/>
<br/>
Let me see it.<br/>
<br/>
Here. I'll make it easy for you.<br/>
<br/>
You can make it not so easy.<br/>
<br/>
Sure thing.<br/>
<br/>
You got it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A guy like you...<br/>

<br/>
You know, that's cute. What else?<br/>
<br/>
[GRUNTING AND COUGHING]<br/>
<br/>
Wow, now, that's impressive.<br/>
<br/>
So many g*ns, I don't know which one to use.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>

And now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500. We agree upon that?<br/>

You want maybe, like, a safe word?<br/>
<br/>
How about "get me the hell home"?<br/>

That'll work. Okay.<br/>

Here. Let me get that for you.<br/>

Here you go.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: Jimmy. Just a sec.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, crap.<br/>
<br/>
What is it?<br/>
<br/>
I must have left my stupid phone on last night. It's dead.<br/>
<br/>
Well, could you put it in the trunk?<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
That everyone?<br/>
<br/>
They'll be here in one minute.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Okay. Shut it down.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. You got it.<br/>
<br/>
[BEEPING]<br/>
<br/>
How you doing? You doing all right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Great stuff.<br/>
<br/>
[JIMMY GRUNTING]<br/>
<br/>
Okay. We're walking.<br/>
<br/>
Walking in, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
[CHUCK SIGHING]<br/>
<br/>
Here we go.<br/>
<br/>
[APPLAUSE]<br/>
<br/>
Good to see you. Welcome home.<br/>
<br/>
Howard, you didn't need to do all this.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I couldn't have stopped them if I wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, let's get you upstairs.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Francis. Brenda. Jose, you shaved.<br/>
<br/>
To date, we have 68 very willing plaintiffs signed to the class action, with the hopes of raising that number to 350 or more.<br/>
<br/>
Many more, now that we know Sandpiper has facilities in five states.<br/>
<br/>
Fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and racketeering.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus. Heh, heh. Guys, this is...<br/>
<br/>
Well, no case is ever a slam dunk.<br/>
<br/>
But I feel as confident about this as anything that's come through our doors.<br/>
<br/>
Francis, start putting together teams to travel out of state.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to these residents.<br/>
<br/>
Pair fourths with our best second years.<br/>
<br/>
Laura will take care of the arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
Kim, Daniel. Take the list of clients Jimmy's signed.<br/>
<br/>
Introduce yourself as the face of HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Make them feel secure and confident.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Howard. I'm glad you're all excited.<br/>
<br/>
But can we slow down a second and discuss terms, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, of course. Kind of shot out of a cannon with this case.<br/>
<br/>
It's exciting stuff you have here.<br/>
<br/>
I get it.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Chuck is already an equity partner.<br/>
<br/>
You, as the lawyer who brought this case to the firm, we could guarantee you, say, 20 percent of the common fund share of the final settlement.<br/>
<br/>
That will work.<br/>
<br/>
That's a few years down the road.<br/>
<br/>
As for money for you now, uh, we don't do referral fees. Chuck will agree.<br/>
<br/>
HHM doesn't view that as ethical.<br/>
<br/>
As we discussed.<br/>
<br/>
But what we could do is arrange an of-counsel fee for the time that you've already put in.<br/>
<br/>
Time that you spent building the case.<br/>
<br/>
I think we could go as high as 20,000.<br/>
<br/>
That, too, will work. Great.<br/>
<br/>
Give us an invoice. I'll have Helen cut you a check.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, got it right here.<br/>
<br/>
And I'd like to use 312 as an office.<br/>
<br/>
It's right next to Chuck's. I'm sorry?<br/>
<br/>
Three-twelve. I know, it's got that view that clients love, but you know what?<br/>
<br/>
That's a waste of space.<br/>
<br/>
The waiting area by the kitchen is just as good.<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
Well, come on, guys. I mean, I need an office.<br/>
<br/>
Can I have the room? Everybody, please.<br/>
<br/>
Just give us a few.<br/>
<br/>
Um, Howard... When the room's clear, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.<br/>
<br/>
You're not working here. What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
You said this case is a slam dunk.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. We want the case.<br/>
<br/>
We don't want, um...<br/>
<br/>
Uh...<br/>
<br/>
The case is all we want.<br/>
<br/>
[SCOFFS]<br/>
<br/>
You gotta be...<br/>
<br/>
You're serious?<br/>
<br/>
I walk in here with a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit on a damn platinum platter.<br/>
<br/>
A case that I found, that I made happen.<br/>
<br/>
And you don't want me? Why in Christ not?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I know that you hate me, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
You better believe, feeling goes both ways.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm willing to set that aside to work with you on this.<br/>
<br/>
Why can't you do the same for me?<br/>
<br/>
What is it that you can't let go of? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
What slight did I make to your fine, upstanding character that you can't forgive?<br/>
<br/>
A majority decision has been made by myself and the partners.<br/>
<br/>
All due respect to you, Chuck, we are not taking in any new associates into the firm.<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit! New associates?<br/>
<br/>
Someone walks in with a case like this, you beg them to be partner.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't want me then. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want me now?<br/>
<br/>
Explain it.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: Howard.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to say.<br/>
<br/>
I am very disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
I really think you should reconsider.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, but no. I think it's best if Jimmy takes the of-counsel fee.<br/>
<br/>
We could probably up it a bit. Keep in mind.<br/>
<br/>
You will be well-compensated in the back end.<br/>
<br/>
It's easy money, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
No reason not to take it.<br/>
<br/>
Go to hell, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not giving you my case.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm gonna tell every one of those clients what a lying miserable pig fucker you are.<br/>
<br/>
I will burn the whole thing to the ground before I give it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, then, if that's your decision.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you moving forward.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...<br/>

[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]<br/>
<br/>
What the hell just happened?<br/>
<br/>
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Come.<br/>
<br/>
Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if you had a moment?<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Just give me a second.<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to talk about what happened today.<br/>
<br/>
With Sandpiper Crossing, things didn't work out.<br/>
<br/>
It was unfortunate. It was a good case.<br/>
<br/>
But... things happen.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: I'm just trying to understand why.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy found that case. He built it.<br/>
<br/>
Did all of the leg work.<br/>
<br/>
The class action doesn't exist without him.<br/>
<br/>
He deserves a seat at the table.<br/>
<br/>
I understand.<br/>
<br/>
But the decision has been made, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
So... thank you for your input.<br/>
<br/>
But... why?<br/>
<br/>
The partners have made a decision and the why is not your concern.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is my concern.<br/>
<br/>
And why is that?<br/>
<br/>
Because he's my friend.<br/>
<br/>
And the way I see it, you're not treating him fairly.<br/>
<br/>
The way you see it?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what image you have of him, past or present, or whatever he did or said, but Jimmy is a good lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
And he works very hard.<br/>
<br/>
Did your friend send you in here to say that?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying it because I believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Well... duly noted.<br/>
<br/>
Want to know what I believe?<br/>
<br/>
I believe that you're way out of your depth in this matter.<br/>
<br/>
So the next time that you want to come in here and tell me what I'm doing wrong, you are welcome to keep it to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Because I don't care.<br/>
<br/>
Stop.<br/>
<br/>
Close the door.<br/>
<br/>
They're late.<br/>
<br/>
Must be traffic.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how this is supposed to work.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, who goes first? Do I hand over the pills first?<br/>
<br/>
Or do they give me the money and then I hand over the pills?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I guess it makes sense if we just exchanged at the same time, right? I mean, that's fair.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we just count to three.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the less talk, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I suppose you could really overthink something like this.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Well, in any case...<br/>
<br/>
Here is what is going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna take the money. You're going to count it.<br/>
<br/>
If it's all there, you hand them the pills.<br/>
<br/>
Easy peasy.<br/>
<br/>
I knew we needed three guys. I knew it. It's a three-man job.<br/>
<br/>
God.<br/>
<br/>
Hello. Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have it? I do.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have the money?<br/>
<br/>
Is it all there?<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
We're short 20. Twenty dollars.<br/>
<br/>
That's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed amount or no deal.<br/>
<br/>
You serious?<br/>
<br/>
You saying I intentionally shorted you?<br/>
<br/>
No. Mistakes happen.<br/>
<br/>
You really willing to blow up this deal over 20 bucks?<br/>
<br/>
Are you?<br/>
<br/>
It's all there. Eighty milligram pills, still factory sealed.<br/>
<br/>
You can pay me now.<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
[SIGHS]<br/>
<br/>
How did you know? Huh?<br/>
<br/>
How did you know not to bring a g*n?<br/>
<br/>
This 1500, I'll just say you're getting a bargain.<br/>
<br/>
I put in a lot of leg work before coming here.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that fella you just met with, name is Ignacio Varga.<br/>
<br/>
He runs with a connected crew of drug dealers.<br/>
<br/>
This deal he's doing with you, he's doing outside his crew.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't want his bosses to know.<br/>
<br/>
So it was in his best interest that things go very smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Hm.<br/>
<br/>
The lesson is, if you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.<br/>
<br/>
Wait. I'm not a bad guy.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't say you were a bad guy. I said you're a criminal.<br/>
<br/>
What's the difference?<br/>
<br/>
I've known good criminals and bad cops.<br/>
<br/>
Bad priests. Honorable thieves.<br/>
<br/>
You can be on one side of the law or the other.<br/>
<br/>
But if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word.<br/>
<br/>
You can go home today with your money and never do this again.<br/>
<br/>
But you took something that wasn't yours.<br/>
<br/>
And you sold it for a profit.<br/>
<br/>
You're now a criminal. Good one, bad one?<br/>
<br/>
That's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
I can get more pills.<br/>
<br/>
And I am sure that fella will keep buying.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you get us home?<br/>
<br/>
You can sleep on it before you decide.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
I was worried about you.<br/>
<br/>
I must have called a dozen times.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. My phone died.<br/>
<br/>
It's one of the perks of living in Chuckland.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere to plug in.<br/>
<br/>
But tonight, it's Jimmyland.<br/>
<br/>
I've got gin. I've got tequila. I've got good Kentucky bourbon.<br/>
<br/>
And you may partake with me in any beverage of your choice on one condition.<br/>
<br/>
You have to listen to me rant about what an absolute unwashed assh*le your boss is.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy... No. It's true.<br/>
<br/>
Don't deny it. He has reached a level of douche baggery that will live on for generations.<br/>
<br/>
Passed down by windtalkers and the like.<br/>
<br/>
He'd rather t*nk a multi-million dollar case than work with me.<br/>
<br/>
That's sick. He has a sickness.<br/>
<br/>
He hates me that much? I hate him more.<br/>
<br/>
What you drinking?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I wanna grab him by that stupid knit tie of his and swing him around.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy... Hamlindigo blue.<br/>
<br/>
How about hamlindigo blow me?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy!<br/>
<br/>
I think you should take the deal.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
I think you should slow down and think about it.<br/>
<br/>
Because taking the deal really is the best thing for you.<br/>
<br/>
You'll find yourself a proper office, your office.<br/>
<br/>
You'll build your practice.<br/>
<br/>
You'll leave Hamlin and HHM behind.<br/>
<br/>
Be your own man.<br/>
<br/>
You want me to give up the case?<br/>
<br/>
My case?<br/>
<br/>
I want you... to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
And I know you want to stay with the case, but... you'll get all the financial reward without the risk.<br/>
<br/>
How can that be bad?<br/>
<br/>
You come here peddling that horseshit on me?<br/>
<br/>
God, you?<br/>
<br/>
You sure know where your bread is buttered, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Don't wanna go up against the boss, that it?<br/>
<br/>
You're like a...<br/>
<br/>
You're like a damn pod person.<br/>
<br/>
What did Hamlin promise you?<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me he didn't buy you off cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Did he promise you the office I asked for?<br/>
<br/>
Or did he just swear never to move you back downstairs?<br/>
<br/>
Take the deal.<br/>

Oh. Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, when did you come in?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. I left my watch outside.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an hour ago. You doing some ironing?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I know things didn't go well for us yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
But being back in the office sure felt good, really good.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna be prepared in case any more work comes my way.<br/>
<br/>
And the space blanket lining in the suit, what a fantastic idea.<br/>
<br/>
It really made being outside much more tolerable.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking about taking a little walk around the block later on. Ha, ha.<br/>
<br/>
That's great, Chuck. You should do that.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, are you all right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn't sleep last night, so...<br/>
<br/>
I was doing some soul searching, and I came to a decision.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna take that deal.<br/>
<br/>
You're sure? This is what you want?<br/>

Kim talked to me.<br/>
<br/>
I got pretty nasty. I'm not proud.<br/>
<br/>
But thinking about what she said, I'd be a fool to pass up that money.<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
And I have zero interest in working with Howard.<br/>
<br/>
So it's probably best that we keep to our separate sandboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Wish it could have worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Imagine that, huh?<br/>

<br/>
Yeah. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep on Howard. Um...<br/>
<br/>
Won't badger him, but maybe I can gradually wear him down.<br/>
<br/>
Get him to come around.<br/>
<br/>
That's...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. I'm so lucky to have you looking out for me.<br/>
<br/>
I'll do what I can. I'm not promising anything.<br/>
<br/>
I get it. It's a long shot.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, he might change his mind.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe there is a way that you could get Howard to change his mind.<br/>
<br/>
How?<br/>
<br/>
Quit.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, no. No, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, it's perfect.<br/>
<br/>
We've already been through all this.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.<br/>
<br/>
But you don't have to really quit.<br/>
<br/>
Okay? You just thr*aten to quit, right?<br/>
<br/>
You get in a game of chicken with Howard.<br/>
<br/>
He's gotta blink, or HHM goes under.<br/>
<br/>
It's a perfect plan. Heh.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy...<br/>
<br/>
If you want us working together.<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
<br/>
You can make it happen easily.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, hey, that reception you got yesterday at HHM, how about that, right? The whole lobby of HHM applauding for you.<br/>
<br/>
They love you.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you thr*aten to pull out, Hamlin would be insane to screw with you.<br/>
<br/>
You've got the nuclear option. Launch the doomsday device.<br/>
<br/>
Game over. If working with me is what you really want, right, Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
You called him.<br/>
<br/>
You called Hamlin.<br/>
<br/>
I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
Two nights ago, it was left on. Battery drained.<br/>
<br/>
I was so damn sure that I turned it off, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Because I always do. It's a habit, right? Heh.<br/>
<br/>
So it was nagging me. It was nagging me.<br/>
<br/>
So I called the phone company.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out there was a deleted call at 2 a.m. when I was asleep right there.<br/>
<br/>
And you know whose number? Hamlin's.<br/>
<br/>
The only person who could have made that call and deleted it is you, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, that phone, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Phone must have felt like a blowtorch in your ear.<br/>
<br/>
All that electricity.<br/>
<br/>
All those radio waves right up against the side of your head.<br/>
<br/>
My God.<br/>
<br/>
What was so important that you had to call Howard before our meeting?<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think...<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that makes sense is you told him not to hire me.<br/>
<br/>
It was always you, right?<br/>
<br/>
Right back to when I passed the bar and tried to join the firm. You didn't want me.<br/>
<br/>
Speak up.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me why.<br/>
<br/>
It's the least you can do for me now.<br/>
<br/>
I'm your brother.<br/>
<br/>
We're supposed to look out for each other.<br/>
<br/>
Why were you working against me, Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
You're not a real lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
I'm what?<br/>
<br/>
You're not a real lawyer.<br/>

When you straightened out and got a job in the mailroom, I was very proud.<br/>
<br/>
So that's it then, right?<br/>
