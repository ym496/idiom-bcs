<br/>
 And your mom, you know, I think she knew we were skipping, but she'd always stop what she was doing and gimme a pack of Little Debbie's.<br/>
<br/>
 Ahh.<br/>
<br/>
 Think all those Little Debbie's put them out of business.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, how'd you get up there when you were a kid?<br/>
<br/>
 Couple of milk crates, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 Ohh.<br/>
<br/>
 [Rattling.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sniffles.]<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah.<br/>

 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 Boom.<br/>
<br/>
 Indian Head penny.<br/>
<br/>
 All right?<br/>
<br/>
 That's worth about three bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 We polish it up, run the coin game Nice.<br/>
<br/>
 We get 150 bucks, easy.<br/>
<br/>
 $150?<br/>
<br/>
 We got a $110 for a plain vanilla half dollar.<br/>
<br/>
 This this is actually rare.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, you can see it.<br/>
<br/>
 - $300, easy.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, $300?<br/>
<br/>
 Me likey.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Now you're gonna tell me what your coin collection was doin' up there.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 It's a long story.<br/>
<br/>
 Um let's get outta here.<br/>
<br/>
 [Siren wails, flashlight clicks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Wailing continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Dog barking in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 - All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Now.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's hit it.<br/>
<br/>
 - No, there might be another one.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Then give.<br/>
<br/>
 What's the deal with the coins?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Well, uh [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 I was what?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, 12 or so?<br/>
<br/>
 I was working the register.<br/>
<br/>
 Guy comes in, buys a box of Ivory Flakes and a sixer of Old Style.<br/>
<br/>
 He pays with a couple bucks and this.<br/>
<br/>
 The second I see it, I know what it is it's a George Washington silver.<br/>
<br/>
 I tell my dad, "Pop, this quarter is rare.<br/>
<br/>
 It's worth four bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 " Barely get the words outta my mouth he hightails it outta here to give it back.<br/>
<br/>
 He can't find the guy, so he tapes it to the side of the register he's hoping [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 that this guy will come back so we can return it.<br/>
<br/>
 After about a week, he starts talking about givin' it to Father Mahoney for the poor box, so I make it disappear.<br/>
<br/>
 And after that, every day after school, I'm checking the till.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, something catches my eye, I stick it in the box, put it up there for good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 So much for good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 It was a cryin' shame they lost this place.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 They never shoulda bought it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
 My dad didn't have it in him.<br/>
<br/>
 Whaddya mean?<br/>
<br/>
 Your folks worked so hard.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, they worked hard!<br/>
<br/>
 They worked a lotta hours for a lotta years.<br/>
<br/>
 For nothin'.<br/>
<br/>
 I dunno, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 He had a lotta customers.<br/>
<br/>
 Everybody liked him.<br/>
<br/>
 Everybody liked him 'cause he was a soft touch.<br/>
<br/>
 You know?<br/>
<br/>
 Every deadbeat in the neighborhood owed him money.<br/>
<br/>
 You come in here with a sob story, you leave with a pat on the back and a gallon of milk.<br/>
<br/>
 He he coulda made it work.<br/>
<br/>
 He coulda sold beer and cigarettes to the kids from Mary-Margaret's, but [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 oh, no, not him.<br/>
<br/>
 He was never gonna do what he had to do.<br/>
<br/>
 [Siren wailing.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 How'd you know there'd be another?<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Dog barking in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Banquet's over.<br/>
<br/>
 Those conventioneers been talking farm equipment for 10 hours straight now they wanna party.<br/>
<br/>
 Gonna be a big night, my friend.<br/>
<br/>
 Whaddya say?<br/>
<br/>
 - Time to get moving?<br/>
<br/>
 - Let's go.<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicle approaches.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Breaks squeal.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Gearshift clicks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Engine shuts off.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Keys jingle.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Trunk squeaks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind rushing, insects chirping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Metal detector beeping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Metal detector beeps loudly.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clatters.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Metal detector beeping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Metal detector beeping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Tribal police?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I was out on your property this afternoon and found a dead body.<br/>
<br/>
 Off the old post road.<br/>
<br/>
 Out in the scrub, just past the Oasis Motel billboard.<br/>
<br/>
 I was out with my metal detector, looking for arrowheads.<br/>
<br/>
 No, I don't want to give my name.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I-I was trespassing.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, y-you'd better send someone out there to find him before the coyotes do.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck: Over here, I've recorded the location of the incident, that is where I was physically when it began.<br/>
<br/>
 This column gives a proximate origin uh, and as you can see, uh, much of time, I couldn't be sure, so I just wrote "ambient.<br/>
<br/>
 " Um, and, of course, I've recorded the, uh, times and dosages of the medicine.<br/>
<br/>
 This is very impressive, Charles.<br/>
<br/>
 And look at the trend!<br/>
<br/>
 Day one, pain of 7 and 8, even 8. 5.<br/>
<br/>
 Day three, nothing higher than five and a quarter.<br/>
<br/>
 And now it's all 3s and 4s.<br/>
<br/>
 Later in the session, I'd like to give you some exercises and strategies that might help even more.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm all ears.<br/>
<br/>
 How do you see your next steps?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, clearly, with this kind of improvement, [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 it won't be long before I'm back to work full time, with no accommodations.<br/>
<br/>
 And then, soon after, I want to get back into court.<br/>
<br/>
 I haven't argued a case in almost three years, so that's next.<br/>
<br/>
 And I'm gonna get these lights turned back on.<br/>
<br/>
 I want this house to be full of music.<br/>
<br/>
 I want to have a dinner party oh, hell, no.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 A great, big celebration.<br/>
<br/>
 I want a hundred people in here, spilling out onto the lawn I want caterers and a full bar.<br/>
<br/>
 I want to be surrounded by friends and colleagues.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's stirring.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Those are excellent goals.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Doctor, I wouldn't have believed I could come so far so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 And I have to give you the lion's share of the credit.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, it's remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
 But Rome wasn't built in a day.<br/>
<br/>
 I know rushing forward may be tempting, but it's important to give yourself time.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 - You've just begun a journey that could take years.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I suppose, but, um, surely you'd admit that every case is different?<br/>
<br/>
 - Of course.<br/>
<br/>
 - Then perhaps, uh, my recovery might be speedier than your run-of-the-mill patient.<br/>
<br/>
 Isn't that possible?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just cautioning you not to push yourself too hard.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 - I know.<br/>
<br/>
 Appreciate every step forward, but modulate your expectations.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Let's talk about the night you first called me.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 - You sounded very distressed.<br/>
<br/>
 I was.<br/>
<br/>
 Using a telephone must have been difficult for you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 I had to walk 10 blocks to a pay phone.<br/>
<br/>
 That was extremely uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
 P-Probably almost a 9.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply, clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 What made it so important to talk to me that night?<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 I'd had an incident.<br/>
<br/>
 A very public incident.<br/>
<br/>
 Perhaps the worst experience of my life.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 It was proven to me, in public, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there was a battery a fully charged battery almost next to my skin for the better part of two hours.<br/>
<br/>
 And I felt nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 What does that mean to you?<br/>
<br/>
 [Clicks tongue.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales deeply.]<br/>
<br/>
 This condition to me, it's as real as that chair.<br/>
<br/>
 It's as real as this house.<br/>
<br/>
 It's as real as you.<br/>
<br/>
 But what if it's not?<br/>
<br/>
 What if it's all in my head?<br/>
<br/>
 And if that's true if it's not real then what have I done?<br/>
<br/>
 [Clock ticking.]<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: It's all in the storyboards.<br/>
<br/>
 Get set for the master shot.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Lookin' good!<br/>
<br/>
 We about ready?<br/>
<br/>
 - Just about.<br/>
<br/>
 - I gotta hand it to you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, this is the busiest weekday we've had in the last six months.<br/>
<br/>
 And are people mentioning the commercial?<br/>
<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
<br/>
 They are.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Excellent!<br/>
<br/>
 - I know.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, here's your partner.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, get him into make-up, and we can carve this turkey.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen.<br/>
<br/>
 L Ex-excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
 Not now.<br/>
<br/>
 - It's all right.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I just got off the phone with the station.<br/>
<br/>
 You don't even work for them.<br/>
<br/>
 I never said I work for the station.<br/>
<br/>
 I [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 Saul Goodman Productions, remember?<br/>
<br/>
 You work with us so you don't have to deal with the bureaucrats at KWBV.<br/>
<br/>
 We take care of everything.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Remind me, how much is all this gonna cost?<br/>
<br/>
 Exactly what we talked about the other day.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 The first one was gratis.<br/>
<br/>
 That's my treat.<br/>
<br/>
 Now we're moving on to the Elite package seven commercials for the heavily discounted price - of $6,500.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 The station just quoted me $450 per.<br/>
<br/>
 - $450?<br/>
<br/>
 - That's for air time only.<br/>
<br/>
 Call the station.<br/>
<br/>
 Ask them how much they'd charge for production of seven top-flight TV commercials.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, but why do we need seven new ones in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 What what's to stop us from paying the station to just keep running the one we have?<br/>
<br/>
 That's not what we agreed to.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 How about that for starters?<br/>
<br/>
 He did give us the first one for free.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, how about this how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?<br/>
<br/>
 Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial it doesn't actually belong to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, it's the real and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, it's our faces.<br/>
<br/>
 - It's our store.<br/>
<br/>
 - And it's my commercial.<br/>
<br/>
 And you can't run it without my permission.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Want to play it like that?<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 - Okay $450 is now off the table.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah, and that crew of yours?<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Just a bunch of UNM students.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can get those.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can get students.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can get students.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes, we can.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can reshoot the ad - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 - and then run that - How about that?<br/>
<br/>
 Guys.<br/>
<br/>
 Guys, come on.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, you wouldn't even be thinking about a commercial if it wasn't for me!<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, we are not gonna pay you $6,500 for something that we can do ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
 - You got it?<br/>
<br/>
 - Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
 - Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 - Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 - Th - Excuse us.<br/>
<br/>
 [Cash register beeping, printing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Hello, there.<br/>
<br/>
 Anything we can help you with?<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Guitar playing in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Indistinct conversations.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Metal squeaks.]<br/>
<br/>
 - What?<br/>
<br/>
 - Put that camera back up.<br/>
<br/>
 Roll it.<br/>
<br/>
 - It's not gonna do a damn thing.<br/>
<br/>
 - Don't give me any lip, okay?<br/>
<br/>
 Just roll it.<br/>
<br/>
 Make sure it's pointed in my direction.<br/>
<br/>
 [Conversation continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Now, if you're gigging a lot - Are you gigging a lot?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, guys.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
 Just want to make sure there's no wiggle room here?<br/>
<br/>
 - We are with customers right now.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Please, all right?<br/>
<br/>
 Just go.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, well, best of luck in all your future endeavors.<br/>
<br/>
 - Go.<br/>
<br/>
 Goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
 - Go.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
 [Drum clangs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Oh!<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, my gosh!<br/>
<br/>
 Are you okay?<br/>
<br/>
 - [Groans.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Groaning.]<br/>
<br/>
 It was a drumstick.<br/>
<br/>
 It was laying loose in the aisle.<br/>
<br/>
 - Somebody call an ambulance!<br/>
<br/>
 - No, you don't need to [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 I don't need Aah!<br/>
<br/>
 [Gasps.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, an ambulance.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
 You guys have liability insurance, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin: To our "Four Corners Strategy" - Cheers to that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Cheers.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chatter.]<br/>
<br/>
 Mmm.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not saying this to rush you, but I have a 2:45 tee time at Four Hills - so don't let me get, uh, long-winded.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I've heard the water gets tricky on the back nine there.<br/>
<br/>
 You heard right.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't know you played.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, growing up where I did, there was pretty much nothing else to do.<br/>
<br/>
 We oughta be having this meeting out on the fairway.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I think Kim has a lot to cover.<br/>
<br/>
 Speaking of which Sorry, but I-I gotta ask.<br/>
<br/>
 I've got a friend, Billy Gatwood.<br/>
<br/>
 He's a driller, has a small operation over near Farwell.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, the poor bastard's tangled up in some kind of an interstate wrangle between Texas and New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, I can't make heads or tails of it, and neither can he.<br/>
<br/>
 His lawyer was a local guy, completely over his head.<br/>
<br/>
 So Billy's fired the guy, but now he doesn't know whether to shit or wind his watch pardon my French.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Howard: Right this way.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyhow, I told him about the job you're doing for us, and I know he'd love to talk to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Montana, I'd suggest Big Sky.<br/>
<br/>
 It's got all the beauty of Montana, but you don't have to wait as long in the lift lines.<br/>
<br/>
 - Another - Oh, wow.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't tell you how flattering that is.<br/>
<br/>
 Paige: Remember, Kim's got her hands full with Utah and Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
 As far as I'm concerned, she's proven she can field whatever we throw at her and then some.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin, your faith in me is it's it means a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 But when we first started working together, I promised you Mesa Verde would be my sole focus.<br/>
<br/>
 And I meant it.<br/>
<br/>
 - Well, sure, but I gotta take - Howard: Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
 I thought I saw some familiar faces.<br/>
<br/>
 - Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim sit.<br/>
<br/>
 I insist.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kevin - Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 Paige always wonderful to see you.<br/>
<br/>
 You, too, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 How've you been?<br/>
<br/>
 Fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 All's well with the expansion?<br/>
<br/>
 I saw you got that branch approved on your original timeline, after all.<br/>
<br/>
 - We did.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks to Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Wexler here.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Well, Kim's one of the best.<br/>
<br/>
 You're lucky to have her.<br/>
<br/>
 She sure is, and we sure are.<br/>
<br/>
 Seems like just yesterday she was logging hours in doc review.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Always a pleasure to see one of our protÃ©gÃ©es spread her wings and leave the nest.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I'll get out of your hair.<br/>
<br/>
 Best of luck to all of you.<br/>
<br/>
 You, too, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 I appreciate that we've got you all to ourselves, but I'm thinking Billy just needs a consultation I'm so sorry, um, but, uh, would you excuse me for just a moment?<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 [Soft music playing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Howard: I've had the salmon here and the filet.<br/>
<br/>
 if you like sea scallops, they're fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, uh, hello again.<br/>
<br/>
 Howard sit.<br/>
<br/>
 I insist.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
 I just needed to give Howard something.<br/>
<br/>
 Folks, this is Kim Wexler, a former member of our firm.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim, uh, this is the team from O'Malley Industries.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, of course.<br/>
<br/>
 I remember Lauren.<br/>
<br/>
 Good to see you again, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, hello.<br/>
<br/>
 - Pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
 Nice to see you, too, Henry, Nick.<br/>
<br/>
 - Marie Austin.<br/>
<br/>
 Good to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 Good to see all of you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Have a wonderful lunch, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 [Music continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry to hold things up.<br/>
<br/>
 - Paige: Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
 - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Kevin, if you want to give me Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Gatwood's number, I'd be happy to speak to him.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, that's great.<br/>
<br/>
 Once I understand what's going on, I'll put him together with a firm that'll take very good care of him.<br/>
<br/>
 I leave it in your capable hands.<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, Utah.<br/>
<br/>
 The good news is the filing requirements are very similar - to what we submitted for Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, good.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks again, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll let Billy know you'll be calling, - and we'll talk tee times soon.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
 - All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye.<br/>
<br/>
 - See you soon, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Engine starts.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 What the hell is this?<br/>
<br/>
 I think it's pretty self-explanatory.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, Howard, you were very generous when I left HHM, but it never sat right with me that you covered my law-school loans.<br/>
<br/>
 It seemed to sit right at the time.<br/>
<br/>
 I appreciate the gift, but now that I'm able to afford it, - I want to pay you back.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, you "appreciate the gift"?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes, I do, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 - You know what I'm doing in there?<br/>
<br/>
 Take a guess.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm doing damage control.<br/>
<br/>
 And I'm doing it three meals a day for the past two weeks with every one of our clients.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm busting my ass, trying to repair the reputation of the firm after you and Jimmy dragged it through the mud.<br/>
<br/>
 I did everything in my power to defend my client.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, is that what you're calling it?<br/>
<br/>
 That's the job, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 And by the way, it was all very convenient for you to ignore Chuck's illness when it suited you.<br/>
<br/>
 So, I take you out of the mail room, put you through law school, mentor you, and then when you leave and s*ab me in the back, that's my fault?<br/>
<br/>
 - [Brakes squeak.]<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm not cashing this.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim, your debt is forgiven.<br/>
<br/>
 But anything else?<br/>
<br/>
 That's on you.<br/>
<br/>
 All Jimmy and I did was show the situation for what it is.<br/>
<br/>
 And if you are hiding that from your clients?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, Howard, that's on you.<br/>

 Check it out.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 That is something.<br/>
<br/>
 I sold the rest of my ads.<br/>
<br/>
 - That must be a relief.<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
 They loved the response they got.<br/>
<br/>
 Were so impressed, they threw in this baby.<br/>
<br/>
 Signed by the one and only Ritchie Blackmore.<br/>
<br/>
 And, uh, lying on the floor helps you with your fingering?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, I fell.<br/>
<br/>
 - What?<br/>
<br/>
 It was during productions.<br/>

 [Chuckling.]<br/>

 Yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
 I saw you yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
 You were fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, that was Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
 You picked up clean clothes.<br/>
<br/>
 'Member?<br/>
<br/>
 Did you go to the doctor?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, it's it's not as bad as it looks.<br/>
<br/>
 I just need to rest it.<br/>
<br/>
 It'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Look on the desk.<br/>
<br/>
 There's something for you.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, that.<br/>
<br/>
 Open it.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 That's my half.<br/>
<br/>
 It's good for the next six weeks.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 So at least we can stop talking about that.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, I wasn't Just take it so we're square, all right?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Just my back hurts like hell, and, uh people suck.<br/>
<br/>
 [Guitar playing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, you you don't have to push yourself like this.<br/>
<br/>
 - You could rest.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Music stops.]<br/>
<br/>
 Let your back heal.<br/>
<br/>
 And then you go to community service and get it over with.<br/>
<br/>
 Take some time.<br/>
<br/>
 Plan your next move.<br/>
<br/>
 Meaning?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm saying I could cover our expenses for a while.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim, you got the cash in your hand.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah, I know, but - So why are we talking about this?<br/>
<br/>
 - All I'm saying is I looked at the numbers, and I can carry us.<br/>
<br/>
 Not forever, but at least until you're back to 100%.<br/>
<br/>
 I appreciate the thought, but no.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll do what I have to do to take care of my half.<br/>
<br/>
 You do what you have to do to take care of yours.<br/>
<br/>
 End of story.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 [Guitar playing.]<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, you believe me, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Feel better, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 [Music continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 Francesca, is it too late to get ahold of the courier?<br/>
<br/>
 I can call.<br/>
<br/>
 Need to reschedule?<br/>
<br/>
 No, cancel it.<br/>
<br/>
 And get Billy Gatwood on the phone for me.<br/>
<br/>
 - Will do.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 [Music continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Intercom beeps.]<br/>
<br/>
 I've got Billy Gatwood on the line.<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 Put him through.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Gatwood?<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, I've been reviewing your documents, and I thought I might've had to refer you to a colleague, but I think I may have a solution to your problem myself.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 Do you think you have some time this week we could sit down and talk?<br/>
<br/>
 [Birds chirping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Dog barks in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 - Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 What a nice surprise.<br/>
<br/>
 I knocked, but there was no answer.<br/>
<br/>
 Thought you were asleep.<br/>
<br/>
 Figured I'd wait, in case Are those groceries?<br/>
<br/>
 They are.<br/>
<br/>
 I decided to go for a little walk.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's great, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Why don't you come on in?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 To what do I owe the pleasure?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I wish it was just a social call, but unfortunately, we do have an issue we need to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
 What's that?<br/>
<br/>
 It concerns your malpractice insurance.<br/>
<br/>
 There's well, we should sit and talk it through.<br/>

 Hey, uh, it's it's my kid.<br/>
<br/>
 Her mom just called.<br/>
<br/>
 You're not supposed to be on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
 I know, I know, but she's sick.<br/>
<br/>
 She caught pneumonia at day care.<br/>
<br/>
 She's in the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
 Please, can I go?<br/>
<br/>
 Sure, you can go.<br/>
<br/>
 But you're not gettin' credit.<br/>
<br/>
 C'mon, can I just go and come right back?<br/>
<br/>
 I have to get my hours done this week.<br/>
<br/>
 Judge says so.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Sounds like that's on you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Freddy scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles passing.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind whistling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, buddy, you wanna get outta here?<br/>
<br/>
 - How much is it worth to you?<br/>
<br/>
 - What?<br/>
<br/>
 To ditch this.<br/>
<br/>
 - How much?<br/>
<br/>
 - Leave me alone, yo.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
<br/>
 You want to get to your deal or what?<br/>
<br/>
 Man, I was just tryin' ta see my sick kid.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 You're trying to sell something you shouldn't have to someone who shouldn't be buying it.<br/>
<br/>

 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 No judgments, all right?<br/>
<br/>
 Man's gotta make a living.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just saying the way you make yours rhymes with "mug mealer.<br/>
<br/>
 " Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 What are you a narc?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here - and let you keep your hours.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - How you gonna do that?<br/>
<br/>
 Lemme worry about the how, okay?<br/>
<br/>
 You just - 700 bucks, and you're gone.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 No, I don't have 700 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, you got a couple grand in your sock.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sniffles.]<br/>
<br/>
 700 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 And you can get me outta here?<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Aight.<br/>
<br/>
 You can do it, you got a deal.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Just go pick up trash.<br/>
<br/>
 Go on.<br/>
<br/>
 [Creaking.]<br/>

<br/>
 [Clicks tongue.]<br/>
<br/>
 Resting.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, hurt my back.<br/>
<br/>
 Get up.<br/>
<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
<br/>
 My back's k*lling me.<br/>
<br/>
 Suit yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 You're not getting your hours.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm pretty sure you're gonna give me my hours.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 And how do you figure that?<br/>
<br/>
 'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna sue you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Hate to break it to you, smart guy, but you signed a waiver.<br/>
<br/>
 I signed a waiver with the city.<br/>
<br/>
 But I'm not suing the city.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm suing you!<br/>
<br/>
 Personally!<br/>
<br/>
 You can't do that.<br/>
<br/>
 Buddy [Groans.]<br/>
<br/>
 this is the land of the free and the home of the lawsuit I sure as sh**t' can.<br/>
<br/>
 And you know what?<br/>
<br/>
 I think I'll bring that guy in with me and make it a class-action thing.<br/>
<br/>
 What's he got to do with it?<br/>
<br/>
 You knowingly prevented him from visiting his child in the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
 If that isn't intentional infliction of emotional distress, what is?<br/>
<br/>
 That's crazy.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Crazy hasn't even started.<br/>
<br/>
 I can also sue you for failure to approve community-service hours that's a direct violation of your duties as an agent of the state of New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm only doin' my job And just for tickles, maybe I throw in failure to treat and mitigate damages suffered by me due to injuries sustained under your watch.<br/>
<br/>
 - Injury?<br/>
<br/>
 - My back.<br/>
<br/>
 You're full of shit.<br/>
<br/>
 - The waiver clearly states - [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Now, that waiver's gonna make Swiss cheese look solid.<br/>
<br/>
 And in a personal lawsuit, it's a fart in the wind.<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind rushing.]<br/>
<br/>
 You're never gonna win that.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
 In order to find out, we gotta do some math.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's see.<br/>
<br/>
 A lawyer's gonna cost you about 90 bucks an hour.<br/>
<br/>
 You're looking at 8 to 12 months of litigation, minimum.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll represent myself.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Great!<br/>
<br/>
 Bring it on.<br/>
<br/>
 You got a car?<br/>
<br/>
 You got a house?<br/>
<br/>
 A pension?<br/>
<br/>
 Kiss it all goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, out here, you might be King Douche-nozzle, but in court, you are little people.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, the judge and I we'll gladly spend the next five years in the courtroom.<br/>
<br/>
 But for you, it's expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 It's very, very expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 It's third-mortgage expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 So I'm offering you a simple choice.<br/>
<br/>
 You can go to your wife.<br/>
<br/>
 You can explain to her you're about to lose your job, your pension, and whatever pinhole of a reputation you've got at the bowling alley on Glow-ball Sundays, or let my friend here visit his sick daughter in the hospital, and you can let me rest my back on this sacred, now litter-free New Mexico soil.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, and we keep our hours.<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind rushing.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles passing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Fine.<br/>
<br/>
 assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, go on!<br/>
<br/>
 Get outta here.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, man.<br/>
<br/>
 That was some Jedi mind shit right there!<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind rushing.]<br/>
<br/>
 The best $700 I done ever spent.<br/>
<br/>
 Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm out.<br/>
<br/>
 [Cellphone dialing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Yo, I'm on my way.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, yeah.<br/>

<br/>
 Mike: I've got a problem I think you can help me with.<br/>
<br/>
 I've got cash I can't spend.<br/>
<br/>
 About $200,000.<br/>
<br/>
 If anything happens to me, my family'll never see it.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.<br/>
<br/>
 And you think that solution could be applied to you.<br/>
<br/>
 As a one-time arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
 It would be unwise for us to be publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?<br/>
<br/>
 Because of the Salamancas.<br/>
<br/>
 If they were to take notice, there would be consequences for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 I'm thinking a paper transaction.<br/>
<br/>
 Even so.<br/>
<br/>
 Perhaps there is a way.<br/>
<br/>
 One with a degree more difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
 But one I may be able to arrange.<br/>
<br/>
 Would 20% overcome this difficulty?<br/>
<br/>
 I would not take money from your family.<br/>
<br/>
