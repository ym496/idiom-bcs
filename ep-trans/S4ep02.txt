04x02 - Breathe
<div class="content">Six every touchdown.<br/>
<br/>
 - But who keeps track of that?<br/>
<br/>
 - It's all on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 Computer does everything.<br/>
<br/>
 Every stat gets converted into points.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 Sounds kind of dumb, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
 - I just wanna watch the game.<br/>
<br/>
 - You're afraid to lose 20 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanna bet, let's do it.<br/>
<br/>
 Why mess with all this extra stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 Trust me, it's fun.<br/>
<br/>
 You end up cheering for a lot of weird things on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
 He's no longer in a coma, but he's unresponsive.<br/>
<br/>
 His condition is stable.<br/>
<br/>
 They're managing his blood pressure.<br/>
<br/>
 But whether he will wake up and understand what's going on around him there's no way of knowing.<br/>
<br/>
 That's unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
 Gustavo, he's getting very good care here.<br/>
<br/>
 There's very little even the best hospitals could do.<br/>
<br/>
 Now might it be different if he was in the care of someplace like Johns Hopkins, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
 Or it could make no difference at all.<br/>
<br/>
 But in the end In the end I can think of no better judgment on this man.<br/>
<br/>
 Isn't this what he deserves?<br/>
<br/>
 I decide what he deserves.<br/>
<br/>
 No one else.<br/>
<br/>
 There she is.<br/>
<br/>
 Want some fresh OJ?<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 Vitamin C.<br/>
<br/>
 It'll help you heal quicker.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't think it works like that.<br/>
<br/>
 It might.<br/>
<br/>
 You don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I've also got leftover bacon from my breakfast sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
 That's got definite healing powers.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, that I believe.<br/>
<br/>
 And I made coffee, put a little cinnamon in it for flavor.<br/>
<br/>
 Just trying something different.<br/>
<br/>
 - You're up early.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, did I wake you with the noise?<br/>
<br/>
 - No.<br/>
<br/>
 No, not at all.<br/>
<br/>
 - I totally did, didn't I?<br/>
<br/>
 - No, I was getting up - Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I got job interviews lined up.<br/>
<br/>
 - eventually.<br/>
<br/>
 I wanted to get an early jump.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm starting down south, office manager interview in Polvadera then I'm working my way up north to Algodones.<br/>
<br/>
 I got a lot of ground to cover.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, you know, you can take some time off.<br/>
<br/>
 Nobody's gonna ding you for not having a steady job right this minute.<br/>
<br/>
 Why wait?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't want unemployment hanging over my head.<br/>
<br/>
 And we could use another paycheck, and Besides, this is your office now.<br/>
<br/>
 - I don't wanna be a distraction.<br/>
<br/>
 - You're not a distraction.<br/>
<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 Because I'll be out finding me a job.<br/>
<br/>
 Wish me luck.<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 Thai or Mexican?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm gonna pick up dinner on the way back.<br/>
<br/>
 Either.<br/>
<br/>
 Your choice.<br/>
<br/>
 And what a choice it shall be.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, wait.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you?<br/>
<br/>
 You're not going to that meeting?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 If there's anything important, Howard knows how to find me.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just me.<br/>
<br/>
 Papa.<br/>
<br/>
 It's over.<br/>
<br/>
 You can keep that.<br/>
<br/>
 No one's coming for it.<br/>
<br/>
 Mijo.<br/>
<br/>
 And when is it over for you?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm working on it.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 You see there, that's Alma, and on the left is Ollie Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Neff's aunt and uncle.<br/>
<br/>
 They started this company almost 50 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
 - Look at that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 And we think that other fellow is Frank Corker.<br/>
<br/>
 One of the early repairmen.<br/>
<br/>
 They must've relied on him a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a Thermo-Fax.<br/>
<br/>
 It needed a specially-coated paper to get an image off one of those babies.<br/>
<br/>
 You know your stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 I worked in a mail room, so I talked to a lot of repairmen.<br/>
<br/>
 A lot.<br/>
<br/>
 They love talking shop.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 They are a lonely bunch, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
 This one was a real big seller for Neff, really put us on the map.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a 6500 color copier.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a warhorse.<br/>
<br/>
 You ever see the guts of this beast?<br/>
<br/>
 It takes 15 seconds to get a printout.<br/>
<br/>
 - I worked with one back in Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
 - That machine was almost too good.<br/>
<br/>
 Counterfeiters used it to make phony $5 bills.<br/>
<br/>
 - What?<br/>
<br/>
 That's - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 That's not right.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, look.<br/>
<br/>
 You got a lot of hardware over here.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Neff loves sponsoring the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 - Bowling, that's fun.<br/>
<br/>
 - We had a pretty good run in the '90s but we don't find kids much interested anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, this generation is all hacky sack and video games.<br/>
<br/>
 Ain't that the truth?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Hummels.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Those were Alma's.<br/>
<br/>
 She loved collecting the little things.<br/>
<br/>
 God rest her soul.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I knew a lady.<br/>
<br/>
 Same way.<br/>
<br/>
 Touring the wall of crap, I see.<br/>
<br/>
 I need to drag that stuff to the dumpster.<br/>
<br/>
 Haven't had a chance to motivate myself.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Neff, James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 - Just "Jimmy" is fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on down, have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
 Guessing Henry filled you in on what we look for?<br/>
<br/>
 He did indeed.<br/>
<br/>
 Office-to-office salesman willing to have multiple doors slammed in my face with one mission: Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade their old copiers to your top-of-the-line new ones.<br/>
<br/>
 You think you have the chops?<br/>
<br/>
 - It's a lot harder than it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'd sure love a crack at it.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm told stubbornness and persuasiveness are two of my top qualities.<br/>
<br/>
 I have to say, he knows his way around a copier.<br/>
<br/>
 No kidding.<br/>
<br/>
 Well Says here you were a lawyer up until not that long ago.<br/>
<br/>
 What changed?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you know why God made snakes before he made lawyers?<br/>
<br/>
 He needed the practice.<br/>
<br/>
 Needed the practice.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - Right?<br/>
<br/>
 That's the only lawyer joke I know because all the others are true stories.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, I know you're looking for somebody with sales experience and I don't have any.<br/>
<br/>
 Except Except being a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, being a lawyer, my job was sales.<br/>
<br/>
 I was selling to judges, juries sometimes I was selling to clients to take the best deal from a series of bad options.<br/>
<br/>
 But every hour of every day, I was convincing persuading, I was selling.<br/>
<br/>
 I hear what you're saying.<br/>
<br/>
 We have a lot of high-ticket items, and a clientele primed to say no.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, my spirit animal is a Gila monster, and once I latch on, I don't let go.<br/>
<br/>
 I like it, I like it.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you make a lot of excellent points, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 I can see why Henry wanted me to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you for coming down.<br/>
<br/>
 - Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 Anytime.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll put our heads together, have a decision in about a week.<br/>
<br/>
 - We'll let you know then.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 - You bet.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes?<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm sorry, can I have another minute?<br/>
<br/>
 I'll be real quick.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, sure, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 What's on your mind?<br/>
<br/>
 I know you're gonna take time, consider your options but maybe we can settle this right now.<br/>
<br/>
 There's a thing that we all know called opportunity cost.<br/>
<br/>
 The time you spend looking for someone is time I could be working for you.<br/>
<br/>
 And sure, there are salesmen out there with way more experience than me.<br/>
<br/>
 What are the chances one will walk through that door in the next week?<br/>
<br/>
 And is it worth the wait?<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 But I can tell you this: None of them will have the connection to your machines that I do.<br/>
<br/>
 None.<br/>
<br/>
 I worked in the mail room.<br/>
<br/>
 I know how important the copy machine is.<br/>
<br/>
 Deadlines, last-minute changes.<br/>
<br/>
 I was in there, clearing paper jams.<br/>
<br/>
 I was cleaning ink off gears and rollers trying to figure out where the mystery streaks were coming from.<br/>
<br/>
 I was down on my hands and knees with my tie over my shoulder and ink-stained hands and a line of assistants out the door, all worried they're gonna lose their job if they don't get their document the next five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 I know I know better than anyone that the copier, it's the beating heart of any business.<br/>
<br/>
 It goes down, it causes delays, that is lost money that is frustrated employees, that's a negative work environment.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a business on life support.<br/>
<br/>
 But you plug one of your new machines into the system that is a healthy, strong heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
 That is a healthy business.<br/>
<br/>
 That is successful business.<br/>
<br/>
 And that's what we're selling.<br/>
<br/>
 One minute.<br/>
<br/>
 - I don't need to see anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 - I mean, he's kind of exciting.<br/>
<br/>
 He's great.<br/>
<br/>
 The passion that this gentleman has - Can you imagine sending that guy out?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Welcome to the team.<br/>
<br/>
 - Really?<br/>
<br/>
 - Damn right.<br/>
<br/>
 Congrats.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll get you set up with Audrey in HR fill out your paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
 Hopefully, you'll be all set by end of day.<br/>
<br/>
 So just like that, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 Why wait when we can get you rolling?<br/>
<br/>
 You were gonna take some time, consider your options but I just come in and did that little song and dance and I'm in?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you out of your mind?<br/>
<br/>
 You don't know me.<br/>
<br/>
 I just came in off the street.<br/>
<br/>
 You guys are like a couple of cats.<br/>
<br/>
 I come in, wave a shiny object around, you're like, "I want that.<br/>
<br/>
 " No due diligence, no background check.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 "Just hire the guy that says them fancy words.<br/>
<br/>
 " I could be a serial k*ller.<br/>
<br/>
 I could be a guy who pees in your coffee pot.<br/>
<br/>
 I could be both.<br/>
<br/>
 - So you're not taking the job?<br/>
<br/>
 - No, I'm not taking the job.<br/>
<br/>
 Suckers.<br/>
<br/>
 I feel sorry for you.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm wondering, are you still interviewing for the sales associate position?<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 I can be there in 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Ellen, okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, thank you, Ellen.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll see you soon.<br/>
<br/>
 Pop-Pop, look how high I can go.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, that's good.<br/>
<br/>
 You be careful.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanna do a couple more?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 This is he.<br/>
<br/>
 Meet at what time?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I can be there.<br/>
<br/>
 You let her know.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 All right, baby.<br/>
<br/>
 Time to get you back to your mama.<br/>
<br/>
 Five more minutes?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, honey, come on.<br/>
<br/>
 - Please?<br/>
<br/>
 Five minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 You're on the clock.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Madrigal Electromotive?<br/>
<br/>
 Down the hall, the Sandia Room on your left.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, good.<br/>
<br/>
 Take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
 You didn't come all this way just for me.<br/>
<br/>
 I frequently travel to conference with distributors.<br/>
<br/>
 Albuquerque is one of many stops.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just looking for an explanation.<br/>
<br/>
 You steal an employee's badge waltz through my warehouse, interfere with operations and strong-arm my facility manager.<br/>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm on your books as a security consultant.<br/>
<br/>
 If I show my face in your warehouse, it makes for a better cover story.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone ever ask if I was there, I was.<br/>
<br/>
 Plus, you had a few things that needed correcting, so consider it a bonus.<br/>
<br/>
 That's not the point.<br/>
<br/>
 This is meant to be a paper transaction.<br/>
<br/>
 You sit at home and we pay you.<br/>
<br/>
 Your own money.<br/>
<br/>
 Doing what you did, the way you did it, raises the threat of exposure.<br/>
<br/>
 The way I see it, it lowers the threat.<br/>
<br/>
 Like I said, now there's a face to the name that cashes the check.<br/>
<br/>
 So what's your plan, then?<br/>
<br/>
 Madrigal has eight terminals in the southwest.<br/>
<br/>
 One down, seven to go.<br/>
<br/>
 And if I asked you to reconsider?<br/>
<br/>
 I'd ask you to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
 At the moment, you have Gus Fring's respect.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd want to keep that if I were you.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry to interrupt, Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Diseth this is Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Maureen Bruckner, just arrived this morning.<br/>
<br/>
 - Nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 - Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Bruckner.<br/>
<br/>
 Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Bruckner's visiting from Johns Hopkins.<br/>
<br/>
 We're asking her to take the lead with some of the more severe cases - including Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>
 - Johns Hopkins?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, a generous grant came through which allowed Dr.<br/>
<br/>
 Bruckner - to lend us her expertise.<br/>
<br/>
 - Only temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not here to step on any toes.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, I Our staff can help with the database whenever you're ready to pull records but I'm available anytime if you have any questions.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Again, I don't wanna step on toes.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can co-manage care, if you like, we - No, no.<br/>
<br/>
 - He's all yours.<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I will let you get to it, then.<br/>
<br/>
 Let us know if there's anything you need, anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you the family?<br/>
<br/>
 Are you the family?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sons.<br/>
<br/>
 He's our uncle.<br/>
<br/>
 I want to let you know that your uncle has been getting excellent care here at Lovelace.<br/>
<br/>
 But we're going to try something a little different.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, when parts of the brain are damaged by a stroke those parts, they cannot be repaired.<br/>
<br/>
 Our job is to stimulate your uncle's brain and teach it to rewire itself.<br/>
<br/>
 We are going to start here with the legs.<br/>
<br/>
 When did they get here?<br/>
<br/>
 Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
 We're still running things.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you family as well?<br/>
<br/>
 Friends of the family.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 As I was saying I'll return later with an occupational therapist to begin some electrical stimulus.<br/>
<br/>
 In the meantime I'd ask that you speak to Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 Chances are, on some level, he can hear you.<br/>
<br/>
 The more you speak, the more his brain will work to respond and find pathways to connect.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay?<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll do everything we can to help your uncle.<br/>
<br/>
 Nice to meet you all.<br/>
<br/>
 Speak.<br/>
<br/>
 Don Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 Everything is good out on the street.<br/>
<br/>
 All our men are keeping busy.<br/>
<br/>
 Real busy.<br/>
<br/>
 That's right, Don Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 We're staying on top of the count.<br/>
<br/>
 It's all looking good.<br/>
<br/>
 We had a problem with that shit g*ng over on Lomas, but we showed some muscle.<br/>
<br/>
 Took care of it.<br/>
<br/>
 No one wants to mess with the Salamancas.<br/>
<br/>
 No one.<br/>
<br/>
 You look good, Don Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 Real good.<br/>
<br/>
 The doctors, they're gonna fix you up.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna get past this and be stronger than ever.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes?<br/>
<br/>
 - It's me.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="display:inline-block"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<br/>
 Can we meet?<br/>
<br/>
 - Now is not a good time.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm in town.<br/>
<br/>
 I can easily meet wherever's convenient.<br/>
<br/>
 Assume this is a secure line.<br/>
<br/>
 I spoke with your security contractor.<br/>
<br/>
 I explained the situation again.<br/>
<br/>
 But he's going to keep doing what he's doing.<br/>
<br/>
 I understand.<br/>
<br/>
 But what he's doing makes no sense.<br/>
<br/>
 - Do his reasons matter?<br/>
<br/>
 - They do if he's unreliable.<br/>
<br/>
 He is reliable.<br/>
<br/>
 So I'm just supposed to let him keep stealing my employees' badges?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know where he'll turn up next what disruption he'll cause, what mess I'll have to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
 This isn't something I want to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
 Then I suggest you give the man a badge.<br/>
<br/>
 Varga and Salamanca's man, Colon, they came by in the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
 Nephews were in his room all day.<br/>
<br/>
 Bruckner saw him three times, couple of specialists with her.<br/>
<br/>
 They took him for a brain scan And?<br/>
<br/>
 That's everything.<br/>
<br/>
 No change.<br/>
<br/>
 You want me back at the hospital?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Call Victor.<br/>
<br/>
 Have him meet us.<br/>
<br/>
 Just a few more.<br/>
<br/>
 I know Chuck was thorough but even I didn't think there was gonna be this much paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
 Having worked with him as long as I did I was actually pleasantly surprised by his restraint.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the agreement for the transfer of property, as discussed.<br/>
<br/>
 If you can initial here.<br/>
<br/>
 And right down here.<br/>
<br/>
 - Am I late?<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 No, right on time.<br/>
<br/>
 We were just finishing up Rebecca's side of things.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi, Rebecca.<br/>
<br/>
 It's nice to see you again.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to talk more at the service.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I don't think anyone felt much like talking.<br/>
<br/>
 - Jimmy's not coming?<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm here on his behalf.<br/>
<br/>
 And that should do it.<br/>
<br/>
 I apologize for bringing us together so soon after Chuck's service.<br/>
<br/>
 It's really my fault.<br/>
<br/>
 Howard's being polite.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Julie.<br/>
<br/>
 In any event, we thought since Rebecca was still in town better to talk through the estate in person.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck left the house to Rebecca and as executor, I'll be liquidating the property.<br/>
<br/>
 Howard suggested, and of course, I agree, that it would be the right thing for Jimmy to go through whatever survived and take whatever he wants.<br/>
<br/>
 - I mean, anything with sentimental value.<br/>
<br/>
 - We can set up a time.<br/>
<br/>
 The estate can provide a truck and storage for anything he chooses to keep.<br/>
<br/>
 That's okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy doesn't want any of it.<br/>
<br/>
 You sure?<br/>
<br/>
 I think the garage is pretty intact, except for some water damage.<br/>
<br/>
 He doesn't want it.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I understand.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, then as far as Jimmy's concerned all that's left is for him to sign this agreement letter.<br/>
<br/>
 Once that's done, we can disperse his share of the estate.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me guess.<br/>
<br/>
 Four thousand?<br/>
<br/>
 Five.<br/>
<br/>
 It's what you give when you cut someone from a will and not have it contested.<br/>
<br/>
 Just enough money to show the recipient wasn't forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck also left a substantial endowment for a scholarship for deserving youth.<br/>
<br/>
 I was hoping Jimmy would agree to serve on the board.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll let him know.<br/>
<br/>
 What else?<br/>
<br/>
 Well Chuck left Jimmy a personal letter.<br/>
<br/>
 His eyes only.<br/>
<br/>
 Howard, thank you for everything that you've done.<br/>
<br/>
 I know it's been difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 It's hard on all of us.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I don't wanna keep you.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me walk you out.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, Howard, we have a few more things to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim, please give Jimmy my best.<br/>
<br/>
 I will.<br/>
<br/>
 It was very nice seeing you, Rebecca.<br/>
<br/>
 You too.<br/>
<br/>
 Safe travels.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 - I just I just had to know what were you thinking?<br/>
<br/>
 About?<br/>
<br/>
 When you came to Jimmy on the day of his brother's funeral and laid that shit on him?<br/>
<br/>
 That Chuck k*lled himself?<br/>
<br/>
 What's wrong with you?<br/>
<br/>
 I thought I thought I owed it to Jimmy to tell him.<br/>
<br/>
 Owed it to him?<br/>
<br/>
 Did you owe it to Rebecca?<br/>
<br/>
 You tell her your theory?<br/>
<br/>
 That Chuck intentionally set himself on fire?<br/>
<br/>
 I guess not.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess you just saved that one for Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim, I didn't do it to hurt Jimmy - You did it to make yourself feel better.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's not what I was To make yourself feel better by unloading your guilt.<br/>
<br/>
 Who cares what it does to Jimmy as long as Howard Hamlin is okay.<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim, I don't think that's fair - Fair?<br/>
<br/>
 Let's talk about fair.<br/>
<br/>
 "Hey, let's let Jimmy dig around the fire-damaged wreck where his brother died screaming.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's let him pick up a keepsake or two.<br/>
<br/>
 " That is so, so fair.<br/>
<br/>
 And did I hear you right?<br/>
<br/>
 You want him to serve on the board of a scholarship committee?<br/>
<br/>
 A scholarship that Chuck never in a million years would've given to Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Never!<br/>
<br/>
 It is just I mean Oh, what's this too, Howard?<br/>
<br/>
 What's in this?<br/>
<br/>
 One last "screw you, little brother" from beyond the grave?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm really supposed to do this to him?<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 What can I do to make it better?<br/>
<br/>
 Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 There is nothing you can do.<br/>
<br/>
 Just stay away.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope you're hungry.<br/>
<br/>
 I bought way too much food.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I can always eat.<br/>
<br/>
 Counter or couch?<br/>
<br/>
 - Couch is good.<br/>
<br/>
 - Couch it is.<br/>
<br/>
 If I remember correctly, in five minutes, one of the classic movie channels is showing White Heat without interruption.<br/>
<br/>
 The other is showing Jaws 3 with commercials.<br/>
<br/>
 So a real Sophie's Choice.<br/>
<br/>
 It is Jaws 3-D, to be exact.<br/>
<br/>
 But Cagney wins this one.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, I got us Thai iced teas unless you want me to pour you something less non-alcoholic.<br/>
<br/>
 No, I'm good with that.<br/>
<br/>
 So how was the job search?<br/>
<br/>
 Pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
 I got a couple leads.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, I got an offer.<br/>
<br/>
 - Really?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah but didn't feel quite right.<br/>
<br/>
 It was It just wasn't a perfect fit.<br/>
<br/>
 But I think I might get a call back on one or two of the others.<br/>
<br/>
 Wow, that's a pretty good first day.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, somebody's gonna be lucky to get you.<br/>
<br/>
 How was your day?<br/>
<br/>
 I just mostly stayed here, trying to get organized.<br/>
<br/>
 No pressure from Paige and Kevin, but I gotta get back on the horse, right?<br/>
<br/>
 You are right.<br/>
<br/>
 And movie's about to start.<br/>
<br/>
 So where is the remote?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not available at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 Leave a message.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, it's me.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, I got something for you.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a job.<br/>
<br/>
 I think you're really gonna like this.<br/>
<br/>
 So call me.<br/>
<br/>
 We're taking six tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 Six keys.<br/>
<br/>
 It's what the boss would want.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna back me up or what?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Where's the rest?<br/>
<br/>
 I only see five.<br/>
<br/>
 That was a one-time only.<br/>
<br/>
 Not the way we see it.<br/>
<br/>
 That's the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
 Salamancas get six.<br/>
<br/>
 We're not leaving without six.<br/>
<br/>
 Your boss isn't giving orders.<br/>
<br/>
 He can barely even open his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm giving the orders.<br/>
<br/>
 Take the five or leave with nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you wanna go?<br/>
<br/>
 You heard him.<br/>
<br/>
 Six.<br/>
<br/>
 Put it away.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you really wanna do this?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, that's what I thought.<br/>
<br/>
 That's how you do it.<br/>
<br/>
 We had them pissing their pants.<br/>
<br/>
 I know what you've done.<br/>
<br/>
 The Salamancas they do not.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you understand what I am saying?<br/>
<br/>
 Look at me.<br/>
<br/>
 From now on you are mine</div>
