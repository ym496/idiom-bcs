<br/>
Drop me off at the courthouse, would you?<br/>
<br/>
 The group has heard my story over and over.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, that's what we're here for.<br/>
<br/>
 How was the job search?<br/>
<br/>
 It just wasn't a perfect fit.<br/>
<br/>
 - Did you get it?<br/>
<br/>
 - Shittin' gold.<br/>
<br/>
 Madrigal has eight terminals in the southwest.<br/>
<br/>
 One down, seven to go.<br/>
<br/>
 "I'm proud we share the name McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 " Man could write a letter.<br/>
<br/>
 I know what you've done.<br/>
<br/>
 The Salamancas do not.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanted me to talk.<br/>

 Done.<br/>
<br/>
 James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 James, hi.<br/>
<br/>
 It's Robbie Finn from CC Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Am I calling at a bad time?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 It's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Um Great.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, good news if you're still interested, we'd like to offer you a position at our uptown branch.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, this is the cellphone store?<br/>
<br/>
 You bet!<br/>
<br/>
 You made quite an impression on Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Boyd.<br/>
<br/>
 He's talking about starting you off as a shift supervisor.<br/>
<br/>
 We can get your training done today, if that works for you.<br/>
<br/>
 James?<br/>
<br/>
 You still there?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, my plans have changed.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not gonna be able to take that job.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
<br/>
 Me too.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a real shame.<br/>
<br/>
 Alright, well, have yourself a good day, James.<br/>
<br/>
 You too.<br/>
<br/>
 You taking off?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, you want Thai for dinner?<br/>

 That sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
 I should be back by 7:00.<br/>
<br/>
 Excellent.<br/>
<br/>
 What's up?<br/>
<br/>
 I was thinking that maybe you should talk to someone.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I got a name.<br/>
<br/>
 He's not far from here.<br/>
<br/>
 I've heard good things.<br/>
<br/>
 Thought you'd give him a call.<br/>
<br/>
 A shrink?<br/>
<br/>
 It works for a lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Um Yeah, well, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Um I just, uh, have to, uh I hafta check out my schedule and Oh, geez.<br/>
<br/>
 I almost forgot to tell you.<br/>
<br/>
 I got a job.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 - Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 You're looking at Albuquerque's newest mobile communications specialist.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm a shift supervisor, even.<br/>
<br/>
 Be very impressed.<br/>
<br/>
 Cellphone sales.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I'm selling cellphones.<br/>
<br/>
 CC Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
 I start today.<br/>
<br/>
 - Jimmy, that that is great.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 It's strictly gainful employment, and then 10 months from now poof!<br/>
<br/>
 I'm a lawyer again.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 But you'll just give him a call when you get a chance?<br/>
<br/>
 Of course.<br/>
<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Coffee's on.<br/>
<br/>
 Have a good first day.<br/>
<br/>
 You can count on it!<br/>
<br/>
 Mr. Finn, James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, I've been thinking it over, and I just can't pass up this opportunity if the position is still open?<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey, Marty.<br/>
<br/>
 - Morning, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 What's on for today?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, let's see.<br/>
<br/>
 Papadoumian has settlement conferences most of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
 Judge Clark has a pair of corporate bankruptcies.<br/>
<br/>
 Munsinger looks like criminal trespassing, aggravated stalking, and some pleading down.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 You got it.<br/>
<br/>
 And you'll have another 14 days from when they file to tell me if you want to amend your request for a pre-trial conference or keep it the way it is.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I gather you're planning to amend, yes?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 - Fine.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll reconvene in 30 days for a proper pre-trial conference, shall we?<br/>
<br/>
 I'll have an order out tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 CR2003114576, State vs.<br/>
<br/>
 Scotty Blakey.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Wexler, do you have a matter before the court today?<br/>
<br/>
 No, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 Just observing.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, counsel?<br/>
<br/>
 Good morning, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 Crystal Eitzmann on behalf of the State.<br/>
<br/>
 It's your turn.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm Scotty Blakey, here for myself.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Blakey, you're here right now because I called this case last week and you didn't show up hence, the bench warrant.<br/>
<br/>
 - Understood?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Your Honor, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Blakey was given a six-month suspended sentence, along with the one-year provision.<br/>
<br/>
 There's no question that this bench warrant constitutes a clear violation of a very generous deal.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm doing the community service.<br/>
<br/>
 - The deadline already passed.<br/>
<br/>
 - Judge Munsinger would like to see you in chambers at the next recess.<br/>
<br/>
 Why do you think you were summoned in the first place?<br/>
<br/>
 The State was prepared to charge this case as a felony and agreed to drop it to a misdemeanor in order to avoid wasting the court's time and resources.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a sha In!<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I don't want to bother you while you're eating.<br/>
<br/>
 Sit!<br/>
<br/>
 Help me take my mind off this.<br/>
<br/>
 Eggplant and okra.<br/>
<br/>
 My wife insists.<br/>
<br/>
 Cholesterol, yadda yadda.<br/>
<br/>
 Hurt your arm, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you researching something?<br/>
<br/>
 No, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 Then you're you're working on your procedure.<br/>
<br/>
 Just observing.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, so, Howard Hamlin's fine with one of his associates just sitting around my court all day, whiling away the billable hours?<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, I left HHM.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm a solo practitioner now.<br/>
<br/>
 - No kidding.<br/>
<br/>
 Field?<br/>
<br/>
 Mainly banking.<br/>
<br/>
 How's business?<br/>
<br/>
 Pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm outside counsel for Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, I I heard about a case, and I think you might be the right person for it.<br/>
<br/>
 Interested?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, of course.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't share all the details just yet, but I can give ya broad strokes.<br/>
<br/>
 There's a young woman, early 20s, pregnant with her first child, nearing the end of term.<br/>
<br/>
 Healthy as a horse.<br/>
<br/>
 She develops a complication.<br/>
<br/>
 She goes to the hospital for delivery, and there's a mistake with the anesthesia.<br/>
<br/>
 She aspirates vomitus into her oxygen mask, stops breathing.<br/>
<br/>
 The baby's delivered fine.<br/>
<br/>
 But the young mother suffers serious brain damage.<br/>
<br/>
 She's left comatose on a respirator.<br/>
<br/>
 The family is naturally devastated.<br/>
<br/>
 And they're broke, so they have no way to pay for the young lady's care.<br/>
<br/>
 And to make matters worse, the hospital refuses to take responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
 And they've hired one of the most expensive firms in the state.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the plot of "The Verdict. " Yes!<br/>
<br/>
 Of course it is!<br/>
<br/>
 Because movies are the only place where those once-in-a-lifetime cases exist.<br/>
<br/>
 You know what I got coming up next?<br/>
<br/>
 I got a janitor who threw his pee on his boss.<br/>
<br/>
 The one after that, she stabbed her boyfriend over a grilled cheese sandwich.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the real world, Ms. Wexler, and you won't find any save-the-broken-lawyer cases in it.<br/>
<br/>
 Don't think that you are the first to try to rediscover their love of the law by trolling my court.<br/>
<br/>
 You're not.<br/>
<br/>
 Best thing you can do is stick to Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 Make lots of money.<br/>
<br/>
 Give some to charity.<br/>
<br/>
 And having said, that we've got perpetual PD overload.<br/>
<br/>
 So beware.<br/>
<br/>
 Next time I see you lurking in my court, I'm gonna put you to work.<br/>
<br/>
 Understood.<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 All rise.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, good afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
 Please be seated.<br/>
<br/>
 Case CR2003114882, State vs.<br/>
<br/>
 Lester Downes.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanted to discuss the conflict of interest.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, before we get started, I'll, uh I'll address the defense's motion to disqualify opposing counsel.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I read your brief very carefully, but I'm not Order's up.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sorry I'm late.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 - Paper?<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 22 across is "Esmeralda. " "Bill ringer's love interest. " It's the Hunchback.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, Quasimodo.<br/>
<br/>
 Look at you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey, Anita.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey, Fran.<br/>
<br/>
 Usual for you?<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Fran.<br/>
<br/>
 You're welcome.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, a girlfriend of mine is playing piano with her band tonight at The Launchpad.<br/>
<br/>
 They're pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanna go?<br/>
<br/>
 Tonight's group.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm, we could ditch.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd better go.<br/>
<br/>
 I told Stacey I'd be there.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe I could stop by after.<br/>
<br/>
 That'd be great.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, speaking of group, I've been thinking about reaching out to Henry.<br/>
<br/>
 I think he needs a friend.<br/>
<br/>
 Every time I see him, he seems worse.<br/>
<br/>
 Henry's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 - You talked to him?<br/>
<br/>
 - Don't need to.<br/>
<br/>
 Then how do you know?<br/>
<br/>
 Because that dead wife he's always talking about never existed.<br/>
<br/>
 What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
 It's an act.<br/>
<br/>
 Why would you even say that?<br/>
<br/>
 The guy's story changes every time he tells it.<br/>
<br/>
 Really?<br/>
<br/>
 No, I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
 That romantic night at the Cubs game, their first kiss?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 - Never happened.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't know that.<br/>
<br/>
 Wrigley Field didn't get lights until '88.<br/>
<br/>
 There were no night games before then.<br/>
<br/>
 None of his details add up.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, maybe he just got the year wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 Why would anyone make up a story like that?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
 Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks, Fran.<br/>
<br/>
 You know you have a very suspicious nature.<br/>
<br/>
 Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 Watch him.<br/>
<br/>
 He's got a tell.<br/>
<br/>
 Like a bad poker player, when he's lying, he rubs his wrist.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 You want to put your money where your mouth is?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you gonna come to group tonight?<br/>
<br/>
 Make it interesting.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 10 bucks says that when he talks about Judy, different story.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 You're on.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 CC Mobile.<br/>
<br/>
 This is Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey-o.<br/>
<br/>
 How was the first morning?<br/>
<br/>
 Good, Robbie.<br/>
<br/>
 Um well ya, actually, it's a little little slow.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, that store's always been a bit calmer.<br/>
<br/>
 Just bring a book.<br/>
<br/>
 So, this is a normal weekday?<br/>
<br/>
 Mostly, but wait till inventory week.<br/>
<br/>
 There's a line out the door.<br/>
<br/>
 When's inventory week?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, you just missed it.<br/>
<br/>
 Is there, uh, any chance that you could move me to a store with a little more traffic?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, let's see.<br/>
<br/>
 The Gold Street store is always hoppin'.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, but it looks like the schedule's all full right now.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's give it a couple weeks, and then we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
 If I can, I'll swing by later.<br/>
<br/>
 Keep up the good work.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 See you then.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye.<br/>
<br/>
 Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, amigos.<br/>
<br/>
 - Aah!<br/>
<br/>
 - Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
 Salamancas.<br/>
<br/>
 Ugh!<br/>
<br/>
 We cleared out the Espinosas.<br/>
<br/>
 They're all done.<br/>
<br/>
 And the Salamanca brothers?<br/>
<br/>
 Marco took a hit, but he'll pull through.<br/>
<br/>
 They went back south until the heat dies down.<br/>
<br/>
 It's territory, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
 Salamancas wipe out the Espinosas.<br/>
<br/>
 Espinosa territory is up for grabs.<br/>
<br/>
 The cartel can't give it to the Salamancas, so I think they give it to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Get some rest.<br/>
<br/>
 You have more to do.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a service to the people.<br/>
<br/>
 It really is.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a nonprofit.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479" data-full-width-responsive="true" style="display:inline-block"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<br/>
 And it's a perfect fit, I mean, what with his degree in sociology and all.<br/>
<br/>
 I think he's really come a long way.<br/>
<br/>
 It He hasn't even talked about getting a job until this week.<br/>
<br/>
 The place is called the Whoops.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Willa, you hadn't quite finished.<br/>
<br/>
 It's called the North Fourth Art Center.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope he takes the job.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, thank you, Willa.<br/>
<br/>
 That all sounds really promising.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyone else?<br/>
<br/>
 Stacey.<br/>
<br/>
 Um today, I-I got up, and I took a shower.<br/>
<br/>
 Kaylee woke up on her own and got herself ready for school.<br/>
<br/>
 It was just a regular morning.<br/>
<br/>
 I made French toast for breakfast, and we talked about the self-pasting toothbrush she's making for the science fair.<br/>
<br/>
 I took her to school and went to work.<br/>
<br/>
 And then I realized it.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know why I noticed it just then, but I hadn't thought about Matty all morning not once.<br/>
<br/>
 When I was making French toast, why didn't I remember that I-it's his favorite?<br/>
<br/>
 I think about Matty every single time I make breakfast, but not today.<br/>
<br/>
 And they weren't just minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 There were hours that I didn't think about him.<br/>
<br/>
 And if I can go hours, then then then why not a whole day?<br/>
<br/>
 Why not a whole week?<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, what if I lose the sound of his voice?<br/>
<br/>
 What if I forget him completely?<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, I know I won't.<br/>
<br/>
 That's, like, impossible, but I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Stacey.<br/>
<br/>
 You're not alone, truly.<br/>
<br/>
 And it might be painful, but if if you ask me, I'd say it's progress.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean a lot of us in this room have felt the same things you're talking about.<br/>
<br/>
 I know I have.<br/>
<br/>
 I keep trying to get there, you know, to live in the here and now.<br/>
<br/>
 I know that's what Judy would have wanted, but it's hard.<br/>
<br/>
 This guy at work I've been avoiding him for the last two weeks, ever since he got back from his vacation to Australia.<br/>
<br/>
 She always wanted to go to Sydney, but money was tight.<br/>
<br/>
 Finally, we were gonna go, for our 25th, and that's when she got her test results.<br/>
<br/>
 Ugh, God.<br/>
<br/>
 Mike, you have something you want to add?<br/>
<br/>
 You don't want to hear what I have to say.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, we're ready if you are.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 This guy was never married.<br/>
<br/>
 What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
 Mike, now, you know the rules.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I know your rules.<br/>
<br/>
 He's been coming in here for months selling you a bill of goods, getting you all misty-eyed and loving every minute of it.<br/>
<br/>
 - Pop - Stop.<br/>
<br/>
 That's just not true.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 So, I'll go to the public library and I'll get the papers from 1997 and I'll run a search on Judy DeVore, beloved wife of Henry DeVore.<br/>
<br/>
 Tell me I'll find her obituary.<br/>
<br/>
 She wanted to go to Australia?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, last month, it was Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on, Henry.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's look at the papers, see if the math works.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
<br/>
 Mike.<br/>
<br/>
 She's not there, is she?<br/>
<br/>
 Go on.<br/>
<br/>
 Say it.<br/>
<br/>
 You have no shame.<br/>
<br/>
 Well he came to the right place, didn't he?<br/>
<br/>
 He knew you wouldn't notice.<br/>
<br/>
 And you didn't.<br/>
<br/>
 All wrapped up in your sad, little stories, feeding off each other's misery.<br/>
<br/>
 You wanted me to talk.<br/>
<br/>
 I talked.<br/>
<br/>
 Mijo.<br/>
<br/>
 Papa.<br/>
<br/>
 Papa, no.<br/>
<br/>
 Papa.<br/>
<br/>
 911.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Hello?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 This one?<br/>
<br/>
 Unh-unh.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 This one.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure thing.<br/>
<br/>
 Hernandez and Sullivan.<br/>
<br/>
 They led the pack and load.<br/>
<br/>
 My top guys.<br/>
<br/>
 Mhm-kay.<br/>
<br/>
 What's that say?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh It's not a guessing game.<br/>
<br/>
 38 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
 Should be 35.<br/>
<br/>
 Musta come in set wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 Goes out set right.<br/>
<br/>
 Manifest doesn't say anything about Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll fix that.<br/>
<br/>
 These okay with you?<br/>
<br/>
 Are you talking about the strap?<br/>
<br/>
 I am.<br/>
<br/>
 Might be a little frayed, but the rest of them are fine.<br/>
<br/>
 And you know this how?<br/>
<br/>
 So, we're pulling all the E track straps?<br/>
<br/>
 Is that a question?<br/>
<br/>
 We'll pull them.<br/>
<br/>
 Call for Ehrmantraut.<br/>
<br/>
 Ehrmantraut.<br/>
<br/>
 He wants to see you.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 Tonight.<br/>
<br/>
 Hold on.<br/>
<br/>
 We're not done yet.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm a Fanta guy myself.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, well, you can buy a truckload.<br/>
<br/>
 Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, whoa.<br/>
<br/>
 Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
 This is, uh, more than we talked about.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, Bavarian Boy made quite a splash at the collectibles expo.<br/>
<br/>
 Bidding w*r.<br/>
<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
<br/>
 But great.<br/>
<br/>
 We both know you could have kept most of this.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I would have never known the difference.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, well, you could have left me high and dry.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm liking this Hummel thing.<br/>
<br/>
 The cash came fast and clean.<br/>
<br/>
 Got any more where that came from?<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 No, not really.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah, bummer.<br/>
<br/>
 We're gonna do this again.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll find something.<br/>
<br/>
 Sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
 When you do, call the vet.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 New job new phone.<br/>
<br/>
 You never know who's listening.<br/>
<br/>
 You want to see me.<br/>
<br/>
 Here I am.<br/>
<br/>
 In order for our arrangement to continue, there is a matter we need to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have something to tell me?<br/>
<br/>
 If you do, you would be well advised to do so.<br/>
<br/>
 Nacho Varga.<br/>
<br/>
 I wondered when you were gonna get around to this.<br/>
<br/>
 You came to me.<br/>
<br/>
 You asked for a favor.<br/>
<br/>
 You looked me in the eye, you shook my hand, and all the while, you knew Varga was moving against my interests.<br/>
<br/>
 I said I wouldn't k*ll Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>
 I never promised to be his bodyguard.<br/>
<br/>
 So what now?<br/>
<br/>
 You gonna make a move, you better make it.<br/>
<br/>
 But they're not gonna, are they?<br/>
<br/>
 You brought me here because you have an ask.<br/>
<br/>
 So, why don't you stop running a game on me and just tell me about the job?</div>
