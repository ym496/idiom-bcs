We'd be working on your case.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck wouldn't like it.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck has no say in this.<br/>
<br/>
This deal he's doing with you, he's doing outside his crew.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't want his bosses to know.<br/>
<br/>
I had a baseball card collection...<br/>
<br/>
All gone!<br/>
<br/>
You're sure they weren't looking for anything else?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but we can't.<br/>
<br/>
We could have gone home with $800,000, tax free!<br/>

Morning!<br/>

Delivery for McGill.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] What're you doing here?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, it's been a while.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I should come in and check on you.<br/>
<br/>
Did I hear music?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
No, no.<br/>
<br/>
I was just... ‭let me get that for you.<br/>
<br/>
[Grunts]<br/>
<br/>
Good to see you, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, likewise.<br/>
<br/>
You are sorely missed, my friend.<br/>
<br/>
Don't take that as any undo pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Um, I'm thinking of maybe coming in for an hour or two next week.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe kind of play it by ear.<br/>
<br/>
Well, ‭I-if you feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, we certainly would love to have you.<br/>
<br/>
We will take anything we can get.<br/>
<br/>
I'll figure out a day and get Ernesto to give you a heads up.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds great.<br/>
<br/>
[Ice clatters]<br/>
<br/>
How's Ernie working out?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, he's been fine, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Everything on track with, uh, Sandpiper?<br/>
<br/>
Moving along.<br/>
<br/>
Davis &amp; Main are, uh... Really pulling their weight.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they better.<br/>
<br/>
It's a complex case.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's definitely not a two-man job, that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone, uh, heard from Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
I have, yes. I've talked to him.<br/>
<br/>
How is he?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Howard</strong>: He's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which... I have some news.<br/>
<br/>
He's working at Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
Doing what?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, working as an attorney.<br/>
<br/>
Hm.<br/>
<br/>
Clifford Main hired Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, he had his doubts, but he's giving Jimmy a chance.<br/>
<br/>
He had his own people doing client outreach, but every time they would talk to a Sandpiper resident, Jimmy's name would come up.<br/>
<br/>
You know, he... [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Those old folks, they just...<br/>
<br/>
They love him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they do. ‭mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I guess cliff thought it would be a good idea for the case to have that sort of, uh...<br/>
<br/>
You know... continuity.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy certainly has a way with people.<br/>
<br/>
He does.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
They're aware of his background at Davis &amp; Main?<br/>
<br/>
His education?<br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of full disclosure, Cliff did talk to me beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't pull any punches.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to paint a complete picture.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't stand in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Of course not.<br/>
<br/>
Nor should you.<br/>
<br/>
Truth be told...<br/>
<br/>
Kim Wexler pushed for this... hard.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't, uh, you know, stand in the way.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I would, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Assume so.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] That's great.<br/>
<br/>
Good for Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Charlie Hustle, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
[Both chuckle] ‭Yep.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll get out of your hair.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you need me to add to Ernie's list?<br/>
<br/>
No. All set. All good.<br/>

I'm so happy for you.<br/>

You know, things are really turning around.<br/>
<br/>
I'm even thinking of looking, you know, my own place to buy.<br/>
<br/>
In Santa Fe?<br/>
<br/>
Not sure yet.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someplace, uh, closer to Albuquerque since I'm going between the two so much.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
So, halfway points.<br/>
<br/>
Um... ‭yeah, I was thinking, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait, what about Corrales?<br/>
<br/>
Corrales.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, get a nice, little bungalow, or maybe not so little.<br/>
<br/>
Big, open floor plan.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want any walls disrupting my chi, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, but I'm thinking I definitely want some decent acreage, get in touch with nature.<br/>
<br/>
Horses.<br/>
<br/>
Come on. You could get horses.<br/>
<br/>
Man, that would be so amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Too expensive. They, uh, all the oats... right?<br/>
<br/>
It's oats ‭that they're always eating?<br/>
<br/>
It's worth it. ‭and the horseshoes.<br/>
<br/>
You have to get them shoes and nail them with a hammer.<br/>
<br/>
It's totally worth it.<br/>

It's...<br/>

I work here.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Small world.<br/>
<br/>
So, is this the parking lot for the police station?<br/>
<br/>
It is.<br/>
<br/>
You don't know if they validate, do you?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you pull around over there, and we'll have a little talk.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, okay.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
I... I have business with the police.<br/>
<br/>
And what business might that be?<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody broke into my house and stole my property.<br/>
<br/>
Your dr*gs.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but obviously ‭I didn't tell the cops that.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not stupid.<br/>
<br/>
You've already spoken to them?<br/>
<br/>
A couple of them came by my house.<br/>
<br/>
But it's not the dr*gs that I care about.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I care.<br/>
<br/>
It's my baseball cards I need back.<br/>
<br/>
Your baseball cards?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
I have a very valuable collection of baseball cards, and someone stole them.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I shouldn't be surprised I have to tell you this.<br/>
<br/>
But it's probably a bad idea that you willingly talk to the police, being a criminal and all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not here as a criminal.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here as a crime victim.<br/>
<br/>
Just because I occasionally sell some pharmaceuticals, I no longer have a right to protection from crime?<br/>
<br/>
And I was very careful when I talked to them.<br/>
<br/>
I... they have no idea about my other business.<br/>
<br/>
If you already made your report, why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
They called me.<br/>
<br/>
They have a few more questions.<br/>
<br/>
They are very dedicated to finding this thief.<br/>
<br/>
Since you're new to this, let me explain it to you.<br/>
<br/>
They've invited you on a fishing trip.<br/>
<br/>
What's that? A fishing trip?<br/>
<br/>
Those cops have no interest in helping you get your cards back.<br/>
<br/>
You're obviously under suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
There was nothing there for them to see.<br/>
<br/>
I refer you ‭to our previous conversation and this blinking neon sign of a vehicle that says "drug dealer."<br/>
<br/>
They suspect you.<br/>
<br/>
They will get you in there, pretend to be your friend, lull you into a false sense of security, and then they will sweat you.<br/>
<br/>
And you will break.<br/>
<br/>
I don't... I... [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Not open for debate. You go home now.<br/>
<br/>
But I have an appointment.<br/>
<br/>
Break it.<br/>
<br/>
And if they call you, do not answer the phone.<br/>
<br/>
But what about my baseball cards?<br/>
<br/>
Cost of doing business.<br/>
<br/>
No!<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no!<br/>
<br/>
I am getting those back!<br/>
<br/>
I will take the risk!<br/>
<br/>
No, you won't.<br/>
<br/>
Because then you'll be putting my well-being at risk.<br/>
<br/>
I have to!<br/>
<br/>
I... I... [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Those cards?<br/>
<br/>
Some of them were my dad's.<br/>
<br/>
I... I am getting them back.<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting them back.<br/>

<br/>
How you settling in?<br/>
<br/>
Great.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, it's... ‭it's quite a step up for me.<br/>

Well, we're happy to have you.<br/>
<br/>
Just let us know if there's anything else you need, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks... Cliff.<br/>
<br/>
Um, I'm happy to be here.<br/>
<br/>
Great.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, better get back to it.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, me, too, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, um, ‭I might have found something in the initial disclosures.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah? Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to the "optional allowance program," but I checked a number of residents' contracts.<br/>
<br/>
Not a single one has opted out, which makes me think it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
And you're thinking that's the "failure to state a claim" that they filed in their answer?<br/>
<br/>
They keep saying it's optional, thereby voluntary.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can counter that if "opting in" is a requirement for residency, which it sure seems to be, well, their voluntary claims don't hold water.<br/>
<br/>
Might be on to something here.<br/>
<br/>
Nice work, Jimmy.<br/>

<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
[Sniffs]<br/>
<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
Baseball cards.<br/>
<br/>
The way I figure, you saw that mid-life crisis of a vehicle and wisely decided ‭to cut ties with the man, and I don't blame you... I did, too.<br/>
<br/>
And then you ripped him off.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sure those baseball cards looked like an easy way to make a few extra bucks off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.<br/>
<br/>
But you underestimated just how big an idiot you were dealing with.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] No, I am pretty aware.<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, you underestimated how attached the man was to those cards... so attached, he called the police and reported them stolen.<br/>
<br/>
Now they're nosing around.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like a "you" problem.<br/>
<br/>
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.<br/>
<br/>
But [Whistles] Good luck to you.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I was hoping you'd see our dilemma and do the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
But I think what we have here now is a carrot-and-stick situation.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
This the stick? Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
You coming here, threatening my family?<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause you're gonna need a bigger stick, old man.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not here to thr*aten your family.<br/>
<br/>
And the name of the stick is Tuco Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak, and Tuco finds out about your little side business.<br/>
<br/>
That a big enough stick?<br/>
<br/>
However, I prefer the carrot.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will, too.<br/>
<br/>
And what would that be?<br/>
<br/>
You give me back the baseball cards, $10,000 in cash, and you net roughly... roughly... $60,000.<br/>

Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas, I'm thinking we should t wrangling some of this stuff from the clients themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these folks have hard copies of everything going back to the Eisenhower administration.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, given some of their, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Inconsistent organizational practices, it's gonna be slow going.<br/>
<br/>
[Knock on door]<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry to interrupt.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet, but, uh, deaf as a doornail.<br/>
<br/>
She keeps all of her paperwork in, um, she keeps it...<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna need everybody's phone, key fobs, and electronics.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck. Welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Please. Have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Don't mind me.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, everybody.<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the interruption.<br/>
<br/>
Just pretend I'm not here.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to have you.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, where were we?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
So, I was saying...<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, getting the documents from some of the clients...<br/>
<br/>
We definitely have some pack rats.<br/>
<br/>
God bless 'em.<br/>
<br/>
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe, and I spent the whole afternoon sorting through just a haystack of recipes and half-off coupons from big lots.<br/>
<br/>
But now we've got copies of this woman's monthly statements going back to March 1997, so it might be a little labor-intensive, but our clients will always be our best resource.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, they have ribbon candy.<br/>
<br/>
[Light laughter]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing here?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] ‭My name is on the building.<br/>
<br/>
So great to have you here.<br/>
<br/>
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Why are you here?<br/>
<br/>
To bear witness.<br/>
<br/>
[Cellphone rings]<br/>
<br/>
James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
It's Ehrmantraut. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
You still morally flexible?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I might have a job for you.<br/>
<br/>
Where and when?<br/>
<br/>
Take a seat.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Wormald, thank you for coming in and talking to us.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports that the officers took at the scene, and we have a few ‭small follow-up questions.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, sorry to waste your time. Just standard stuff.<br/>
<br/>
There's really no need for a lawyer to be here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Dan just, uh, wanted a friendly face next to him.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Coleman</strong>: ‭Well, we're all friendly here.<br/>
<br/>
Look at us. Four friends.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
We just want to get the facts straight so we can, um, help you get your property for you.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh...<br/>
<br/>
No, it's just standard procedure.<br/>
<br/>
You know, ‭officers don't always get all the information we need in their report.<br/>
<br/>
We just want to find the guys who took your baseball cards.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's, uh...<br/>
<br/>
You know, my uncle ‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.<br/>
<br/>
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass like it was the Mona Lisa or something.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Ty Cobb?<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to keep the lights low.<br/>
<br/>
Even artificial lighting has a certain amount of ultraviolet radiation that can, uh, you know...<br/>
<br/>
Over the long term...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Um, can you just remind us exactly where you kept your cards in the house?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying to say, it's no longer an issue.<br/>
<br/>
I found them.<br/>
<br/>
So you found the cards?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yep.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to come down and tell you, you know, in person.<br/>
<br/>
You found them?<br/>
<br/>
Where? Around the house?<br/>
<br/>
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator, and he tracked them down.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Really? So, where were they?<br/>
<br/>
You know, it's fine. It is.<br/>
<br/>
I really... I ought to get out of your hair.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you've wasted enough time on me.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, it's... ‭it's okay. It's our job.<br/>
<br/>
We just want to get the facts right so we can help close this case for you.<br/>
<br/>
It's done.<br/>
<br/>
Case closed!<br/>
<br/>
I just... I know how much, you know, you guys have on your hands, like murderers and robbers and gangs and stuff. I...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?<br/>
<br/>
You can have some coffee.<br/>
<br/>
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's get down to brass tacks here, guys.<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing your two fine uniformed officers found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole, and that's why you two are so interested in "helping" my friend here.<br/>
<br/>
I get it.<br/>
<br/>
A hiding place in the baseboard... it's gonna make anyone suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
But let me assure you there's nothing illegal going on here.<br/>
<br/>
Then why is he so nervous?<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm. 'Cause I must say, the flop sweat is kind of suspect.<br/>
<br/>
We all have our secrets, don't we?<br/>
<br/>
And who among us is without sin?<br/>
<br/>
But those sins aren't all of the criminal variety, and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?<br/>
<br/>
They are, however, very private.<br/>
<br/>
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
No, no!<br/>
<br/>
He's being evasive because it's a sensitive subject, very delicate, and of no concern to law enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
You know, as much as we'd love to, um, take your word for it, we're gonna need a little more than that.<br/>
<br/>
All right, well, this all comes down to a personal dispute.<br/>
<br/>
That's all.<br/>
<br/>
It's... it's between, um, Mr. Wormald and, uh... his art patron.<br/>
<br/>
"Art patron"?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, my client has an arrangement with a wealthy gentleman for whom [clears throat] Mr. Wormald provides...<br/>
<br/>
Art in exchange for ‭this gentleman's generous, uh...<br/>
<br/>
We'll call it patronage.<br/>
<br/>
Art? Like... like what? Paintings?<br/>
<br/>
It's more like digital media.<br/>
<br/>
Digital media?<br/>
<br/>
He made videos for the man.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of videos?<br/>
<br/>
Private videos of an artistic nature.<br/>
<br/>
That's what was in the hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
That's what it's for.<br/>
<br/>
So, this art patron stole the videos and the baseball cards?<br/>
<br/>
Well, there was a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.<br/>
<br/>
Artists are volatile creatures.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Guys, this all comes down to just a lovers' spat, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Two consenting adults had a falling out.<br/>
<br/>
That happens.<br/>
<br/>
And the, uh, "patron" stole the videos and the baseball cards, uh, to "make a point," I guess.<br/>
<br/>
But the headline here is, it's all settled.<br/>
<br/>
Hearts have mended, and Mr. Wormald will not be pressing charges.<br/>
<br/>
What was on these videos?<br/>
<br/>
They were private.<br/>
<br/>
You've said that.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
They were videos intended to titillate the senses.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so porn.<br/>
<br/>
Not... no.<br/>
<br/>
Not as such.<br/>
<br/>
Technically, they would be categorized as fetish videos.<br/>
<br/>
But nothing illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Just a man... a fully clothed man, I might add... just all by himself.<br/>
<br/>
Just... just Mr. Wormald fully clothed, uh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
So... all right.<br/>
<br/>
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald by himself doing what?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, come on, man. What?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Squat cobbler.<br/>
<br/>
What's a s-squat cobbler?<br/>
<br/>
Squat cobbler. ‭You know what squat cobbler is.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't... I don't know what a squat cobbler is.<br/>
<br/>
No, me neither. What is it?<br/>
<br/>
What? And you two guys are cops?<br/>
<br/>
Hoboken squat cobbler.<br/>
<br/>
Full moon moon-pie.<br/>
<br/>
Boston cream splat. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
Simple-Simon-the-ass-man.<br/>
<br/>
Dutch apple ass.<br/>
<br/>
Guys, am I not speaking English here?<br/>
<br/>
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!<br/>
<br/>
It's when a man sits in pie!<br/>
<br/>
He sits in a pie!<br/>
<br/>
And he... he wiggles around.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's like hellmann's mayonnaise.<br/>
<br/>
It has a different name west of the rockies.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. But, uh, technically, he does a crybaby squat, so there's tears, which makes it more specialized.<br/>
<br/>
Not all pie sitters cry.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm gonna tell you something.<br/>
<br/>
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.<br/>
<br/>
Pies?<br/>
<br/>
What? Like apple?<br/>
<br/>
Guys, I'm not ‭the filmmaker here, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Banana cream. I... uh, peach.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there... And there is a costume involved.<br/>
<br/>
[Snorts]<br/>
<br/>
You got to be sh1tting us.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, like I would make this up.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, the world is ‭a rich tapestry, my friends.<br/>
<br/>
But trust me on this.<br/>
<br/>
You don't want to see it.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
So, uh, we're good, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Great. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
There is, however, one little, tiny hanging Chad.<br/>
<br/>
Well, what? What Chad?<br/>
<br/>
You're gonna have to make a video.<br/>
<br/>
[Keys jingle]<br/>
<br/>
[Insects chirping]<br/>
<br/>
[Grunts]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: [Laughs] Wait. Wait.<br/>
<br/>
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?<br/>
<br/>
Both. Whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
Which comes first?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, it's dealer's choice.<br/>
<br/>
That's where the crying comes in, right?<br/>
<br/>
That's a safe bet.<br/>
<br/>
[Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?<br/>
<br/>
If you gave me a million years, I still would not have come up with that.<br/>
<br/>
The muse.<br/>
<br/>
She speaks through me.<br/>
<br/>
I am but a humble vessel.<br/>
<br/>
And they bought it?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard some far-out scenarios used to sow doubt, but this definitely takes the cake.<br/>
<br/>
Kim, Kim, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
Takes the pie.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I should just jump off the roof right now.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, can you tell a story.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be fair, I think it was the video that clinched it.<br/>
<br/>
What video?<br/>
<br/>
Wait, wait. You... ‭You actually made a video?<br/>
<br/>
I got to say, in the end, ol' Dan really committed.<br/>
<br/>
I believed the tears.<br/>
<br/>
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't sure how many takes we would need, so I over-bought, but I promise you, ‭untouched by human buttocks.<br/>
<br/>
You fabricated evidence?<br/>
<br/>
I made a video.<br/>
<br/>
Not exactly evidence.<br/>
<br/>
You used it to exonerate a client.<br/>
<br/>
You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client.<br/>
<br/>
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not splitting hairs.<br/>
<br/>
What if Davis &amp; Main find out you faked evidence?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a Davis &amp; Main client.<br/>
<br/>
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.<br/>
<br/>
It was off the clock. It was, uh, totally my own thing.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Why would you risk ‭the best job you've ever had for some pro-bono case?<br/>
<br/>
I was doing a favor for a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Risking disbarment? That's... that's some friend.<br/>
<br/>
It's fine! It... it worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Davis &amp; Main are none the wiser.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see you complaining when, um, Ken the douchebag paid our bar bill the other night.<br/>
<br/>
No, that was a little bit of rule breaking right there.<br/>
<br/>
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.<br/>
<br/>
A lot.<br/>
<br/>
That is so not the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
How? What's the difference?<br/>
<br/>
That had nothing to do with work.<br/>
<br/>
And we were just... just screwing around.<br/>
<br/>
This?<br/>
<br/>
Fabricating evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.<br/>
<br/>
If they find out, if you get caught...<br/>
<br/>
It... they're never gonna find out.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously? You sound like every dumb criminal out there.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep this up, they will find out.<br/>
<br/>
For what, Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
‭[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
What is the point?<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ever again. Okay?<br/>
<br/>
I mean it, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
You won't.</div>
