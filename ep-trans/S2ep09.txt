Thank you for your patience.<br/>

Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
This meeting of the New Mexico State Banking Board is now in session.<br/>
<br/>
We have Mesa Verde here with us today, and they're represented by Charles McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to have you back, Charles.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Good to be back.<br/>
<br/>
I'm here with my colleague, Howard Hamlin.<br/>
<br/>
And may I introduce Mr. Kevin Wachtell, President and Chairman of Mesa Verde Holdings, and Ms. Paige Novick, Mesa Verde Senior Counsel.<br/>
<br/>
Hello and welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I believe staff has found the application to meet the basic requirements for approval.<br/>
<br/>
That's right, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
With your permission, Mr. Wachtell would like to make a brief statement in support of the application.<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the New Mexico Banking Board, I'm honored and grateful to appear before you this morning.<br/>
<br/>
We believe ‭that our proposed expansion is in the public interest both for Arizona and our own state.<br/>
<br/>
For 46 years, the men and women of Mesa Verde Bank and Trust have prided ourselves on personal service and attention to detail second to none.<br/>
<br/>
Mesa Verde continues to operate at a Tier One leverage ratio of 11.2%, and we feel...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, hold on.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me, Mr. Wachtell. Just one moment.<br/>
<br/>
[Whispering indistinctly]<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
<br/>
Well, let's find out.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Mr. Commissioner, is there something we can clarify?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us the address of the proposed Scottsdale branch again?<br/>
<br/>
Certainly.<br/>
<br/>
It's 1216 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85262.<br/>
<br/>
1-2-1-6?<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Because the application I'm looking at today clearly gives the address as 1216.<br/>
<br/>
1216... that's correct, sir.<br/>
<br/>
But in the original submission, we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive.<br/>
<br/>
It is 1261.<br/>
<br/>
‭1261.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you double-check, you'll see that 1216 is correct.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be ‭two different addresses here.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of our notice of intent, which was published in newspapers in Arizona and New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
It clearly states the address is 1261 Rosella Drive.<br/>
<br/>
Mr... ‭Mr. Commissioner, I-if...<br/>
<br/>
1-2-6-1 Rosella Drive.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I have a copy of the notice of intent, too, but on the actual filing, the address reads 1-2-1-6.<br/>
<br/>
So... which is it?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I may confer with my clients?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Commissioner</strong>: Certainly, please.<br/>
<br/>
It's absolutely 1261.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
You are mistaken, and with all due respect, you're muddying the waters here.<br/>
<br/>
"Muddying the water"?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] ‭Look.<br/>
<br/>
Just look.<br/>
<br/>
Well, ‭this is clearly an error.<br/>
<br/>
It's 1261.<br/>
<br/>
I know where my own damn bank is.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, let's just all calm down. I'm sure we can straighten this out.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a building remodel at 1261 Rosella.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.<br/>
<br/>
I-I don't quite underst... 1261.<br/>
<br/>
1261.<br/>
<br/>
Is this gonna be a problem?<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm sure it won't be.<br/>
<br/>
Um, M-Mr. Commissioner, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Unaccountably, there appears to be a... discrepancy in our filing.<br/>
<br/>
So the correct address the one that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261?<br/>
<br/>
It would seem so.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um, an adjournment [Chuckling] of just a few minutes so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh, but, uh... uh, I don't think we can get you back in today.<br/>
<br/>
If I may, when do you think you might be able to schedule us?<br/>
<br/>
I'm being told by staff that they've already done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive.<br/>
<br/>
Our folks are going to have to go back to square one on the new address.<br/>
<br/>
If we... we could d obin a provisional agreement today, to allow the... the branch to open be...<br/>
<br/>
No, no. All due respect, it's up to you folks to submit accurate paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next time, double-check.<br/>
<br/>
Now, uh, the soonest we could revisit this matter... well, it... it looks like six weeks from Friday.<br/>
<br/>
We... ‭We can't wait six weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Commissioner, M-Mesa Verde has put effort a a... resources into preparing this branch to open immediately.<br/>
<br/>
However unusual, a provisional a-approval would be most [Chuckling] appreciated, most welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Time being of the essence...<br/>
<br/>
Charles, I'm sorry. I'll see you in six weeks.<br/>
<br/>
That closes the matter for today.<br/>
<br/>
Will staff please note that Mesa Verde will return in six weeks...<br/>

<br/>

Oh, it sounds like ‭there's some regulatory issues.<br/>
<br/>
Kevin's still worried that one lawyer won't be able to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
You can.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get a paralegal, maybe two of them, and I absolutely ‭will pay for it out of my end.<br/>
<br/>
No. Come on. Split it down the middle.<br/>

<br/>
Well... I'll get goin, then.<br/>

‭Bye, Jimmy. Bye, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
Bye, Ernie. ‭<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: See ya, Ernie.<br/>
<br/>
So, Chuck, ‭what's the deal with the locks?<br/>
<br/>
Kim, I was hoping to have this conversation with you and you alone.<br/>
<br/>
However... I guess it's time to clear the air once and for all.<br/>
<br/>
Clear the air about what?<br/>
<br/>
He sabotaged me.<br/>
<br/>
Buddy, what are you, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Please.<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother.<br/>
<br/>
You and I both know ‭exactly what I'm talking about.<br/>
<br/>
I don't.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life.<br/>
<br/>
A single transpositional error cost my client time and money and permanently damaged my reputation.<br/>
<br/>
But then I realized... it wasn't an error.<br/>
<br/>
Not at all. [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
A week ago last night, I was right there on that couch, barely cononious, and Jimmy showed up.<br/>
<br/>
And he sent Ernesto away.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was gonna take care of me.<br/>
<br/>
And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<br/>
<br/>
She does! You do... for your own good.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in these files are 13 documents containing the address of Mesa Verde's proposed branch...<br/>
<br/>
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy pulled each and every one, then he left me here, sweating and delirious, while he went off to doctor them.<br/>
<br/>
You'd need a photocopier for that.<br/>
<br/>
Where'd you go... some all-night copy shop?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
With a little careful cutting and pasting, he created duplicates... virtually identical to my originals, but with one key change...<br/>
<br/>
1261 Rosella Drive ‭became 1216 Rosella Drive.<br/>
<br/>
This is sounding like a lot of work.<br/>
<br/>
No one ever accused you of being lazy... every other sin in the book, but not that one.<br/>
<br/>
And if you're wondering if Jimmy's up to a little casual forgery, you should know in high school, he had a thrivininbusiness making fake I.D.s ‭so his buddies could buy beer.<br/>
<br/>
You going all the way back to high school, huh?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Hey, you and Mozart, huh?<br/>
<br/>
You both started young.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
He came back here and put his new versions in my files.<br/>
<br/>
And then, the next day, my caring brother took his leave.<br/>
<br/>
He knew that I would use his modified documents to write Mesa Verde's submission to the state regulator.<br/>
<br/>
And so I did, over and over...<br/>
<br/>
I typed "1216" instead of "1261."<br/>
<br/>
I remember thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive... that's just one year after 1215, the year the Magna Carta was signed."<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
So, you're saying, if we look in here, all the addresses will be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Well, of course you weren't gonna leave evidence behind.<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing yesterday morning, you waited until I left, then used your key to let yourself in and return the originals.<br/>
<br/>
No crime is complete without the cover-up.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come on.<br/>
<br/>
I did all this... what... for some business?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
He did it for you.<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm sure you didn't know anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe he went off on his own and did this as some kind of twisted romantic gesture.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down with a cold washcloth on your head.<br/>
<br/>
And now that you know, you have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
This is about a client... a client who has been defrauded.<br/>
<br/>
As a sworn officer of the court, as Mesa Verde's attorney of record, you have no recourue but to go to Kevin Wachtell anmake a full disclosure.<br/>
<br/>
This... This whole song and dance... it's all about getting his client back.<br/>
<br/>
That's all this is. ‭<br/>
<br/>
Not in the least.<br/>
<br/>
If, knowing the truth, they still decide to go...<br/>
<br/>
You can't ststanthe fact that they chose her over you.<br/>
<br/>
I can't stand the fact that my own brother stabbed me in the back!<br/>
<br/>
I can't stand the fact that you've deceived and ruined this fine young woman!<br/>
<br/>
"Ruined"?<br/>
<br/>
What is this... the 1840s?<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about? She's not ruined!<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
If what you're saying is true, Jimmy could be charged with forgery, fraud, falsifying evidence, even breaking and entering.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I am sick about this.<br/>
<br/>
But facts are facts.<br/>
<br/>
And what is your evidence?<br/>
<br/>
My evidence?<br/>
<br/>
My evidence is knowing my brother for his entire life.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, I think ‭there is another explanation... it's a simpler one.<br/>
<br/>
You made a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I did not.<br/>
<br/>
You're wororking by lantern, squinting over 10-point typepe for hour after hour.<br/>
<br/>
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216 would be the most natural thing in the world.<br/>
<br/>
It could certainly happen to me.<br/>
<br/>
I did not make a mistake!<br/>
<br/>
I believe you did.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I understand that you have a... a great affection for Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
A great many people do, but please open your eyes here!<br/>
<br/>
You made a mistake, and instead of just facing up to it, you accuse your brother of plotttting ainst you.<br/>
<br/>
You come up ‭with this elaborate scheme.<br/>
<br/>
He's capable of this!<br/>
<br/>
You know he is!<br/>
<br/>
I know he's not perfect!<br/>
<br/>
And I know he cuts corners.<br/>
<br/>
But you're the one who made him this way.<br/>
<br/>
He idolizes you.<br/>
<br/>
He accepts you.<br/>
<br/>
He takes care of you.<br/>
<br/>
And all he ever wanted was your love and support, but all you've ever done is judge him.<br/>
<br/>
You never believed in him.<br/>
<br/>
You never wanted him to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for him.<br/>
<br/>
And I feel sorry for you.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am, ‭and this is school property.<br/>

You're just the person I want to speak to.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah. Class of '64.<br/>

He still talks about it.<br/>

But the school was built in '71.<br/>
<br/>
Mm. He was a student in the old building that used to be here.<br/>
<br/>
We're taking a little... what do you call it?... artistic liberties.<br/>
<br/>
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, ‭and that's some great trivia, but he spent his formative years right here in Albuquerque.<br/>

[Van door opens, closes]<br/>
<br/>
I've got something I need to know, and I need to know it fast.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] What's that?<br/>
<br/>
Got hit the other day.<br/>
<br/>
A truck headed south got h*jacked.<br/>
<br/>
Someone stole a quarter million.<br/>
<br/>
Now Hector's flippin' out, lookin' for who did it.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is...<br/>
<br/>
I think it was you.<br/>
<br/>
They left the driver hog-tied... not a mark on him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in the game woulda capped him without a second thought.<br/>
<br/>
But this driver? He's still breathin'.<br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself, "Who's the guy who'll rip off a couple hundred thousand in drug money and leave a witness?<br/>
<br/>
Who's the guy ‭who won't pull the trigger?"<br/>
<br/>
You.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
I'm not here to squeeze you.<br/>
<br/>
You wanna rip off the cartel, that's your business.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the thing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm picking up that driver... Hector's orders.<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna see what he knows, and if he knows you, that's bad for both of us.<br/>
<br/>
That shouldn't concern you.<br/>
<br/>
But he was in on it, right?<br/>
<br/>
The driver ‭had nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Then who?<br/>
<br/>
‭Just me.<br/>
<br/>
You're telling me you did is without someone on the inside?<br/>
<br/>
Not possible.<br/>
<br/>
How did you know about the truck?<br/>
<br/>
How do you know about the tires?<br/>
<br/>
All I can tell you is, you guys aren't half as smart as you think you are.<br/>
<br/>
So the driver... doesn't know anything?<br/>
<br/>
Not a thing. ‭He hear your voice?<br/>
<br/>
No. ‭<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Hector's looking at the competition, but he hears the driver say it was some old gringo...<br/>
<br/>
He didn't hear me.<br/>
<br/>
He saw a guy with a ski mask... that's it.<br/>
<br/>
And you're sure of that?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You better be right.<br/>
<br/>
Why wasn't it in the papers?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
The truck robbery... the cops keeping it out of the papers?<br/>
<br/>
The cops?<br/>
<br/>
The cops don't know shit about it.<br/>
<br/>
How's that?<br/>
<br/>
Is that what this is about?<br/>
<br/>
You wanted to put the cops onto Hector?<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
You are nothing to him.<br/>
<br/>
He forgot all about you.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't forgotten him.<br/>
<br/>
You put me in the shit, just 'cause you got it in for Hector Salamanca?<br/>
<br/>
Listen, you put the cops on him, you put them on me.<br/>
<br/>
Doing it for the money... I get it, but this shit... that's insane.<br/>
<br/>
You need to calm yourself down, and you need to take that hand out of that pocket.<br/>

<br/>
I'm done with your boss.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Why wasn't it in the papers?<br/>
<br/>
Because we cleaned it up.<br/>
<br/>
How's that?<br/>
<br/>
We got lucky.<br/>
<br/>
After you left, ‭a Good Samaritan came along and said, "Oh, my God!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God!"<br/>
<br/>
He cut the driver loose. The driver called us.<br/>
<br/>
We came out, got the truck.<br/>
<br/>
Made it like it never happened.<br/>
<br/>
And that Good Samaritan?<br/>
<br/>
Hector shot him in the face.<br/>
<br/>
We buried the guy out in the desert.<br/>

For some reason tonight, I feel like I've got all the answers.<br/>

I'm feeling kind of like, uh... like Carnac.<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember when Johnny Carson used to do Carnac?<br/>
<br/>
You know, he'd give the answers before the questions.<br/>
<br/>
You know, [Sighs] Ed would give him the envelope, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead, and, um, he'd give the answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver."<br/>
<br/>
Then Johnny'd tear open the envelope.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
"What did the dead raccoon say in his will?"<br/>

<br/>
Um, that guy ‭who just walked out of here... his name is Ernie.<br/>
<br/>
I'm guessing he showed you my picture and asked if ‭I was in here the other night.<br/>
<br/>
Now he's going to bring his boss, who's my brother, and he's gonna ask you the same question...<br/>
<br/>
"Did you see that guy the other night?"<br/>
<br/>
Well, the answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
You feel me?<br/>
<br/>
You m*rder someone?<br/>
<br/>
Nope.<br/>

<br/>
No way am I that cool.<br/>
<br/>
I... Sometimes, I go number two and I don't flush, but... this is just a thing between brothers.<br/>
<br/>
And we're both lawyers, so...<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, ‭that's a long and boring story.<br/>
<br/>
You don't wanna know. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Is this gonna get me jammed up with the cops?<br/>
<br/>
My brotherer mht make it sound like that, but... no.<br/>
<br/>
It's just family.<br/>
<br/>
Then I feel you.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, ‭tell me about the cameras.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Uh, they go to a VCR in the back.<br/>
<br/>
It, uh, tapes for 12 hours and then records over itself.<br/>
<br/>
Right. So I'm on there now?<br/>
<br/>
How hard would it be to erase?<br/>
<br/>
Mm. I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
