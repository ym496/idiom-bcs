<br/>
 I don't want to talk About things we've gone through Though it's hurting me Now it's history Get up here.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I've played all my cards And that's what you've done, too Chuck McGill, everyone!<br/>

<br/>
 Nothing more to say No more ace to play The winner takes it all That's you!<br/>

 That's her destiny Whoo!<br/>
<br/>
 I was in your arms - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thinking I belonged there I figured it made sense Building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool Playing by the rules - The - The gods may throw the dice Their minds as cold as ice And someone way down here Loses someone dear The winner takes it all Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, watch.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, watch your step, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 All the way.<br/>
<br/>
 That's it.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's it.<br/>
<br/>
 - McGill and McGill, - the brothers McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - And you're lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 - Two lawyers.<br/>
<br/>
 How 'bout that?<br/>
<br/>
 - How 'bout that?<br/>
<br/>
 M&amp;M.<br/>
<br/>
 Melts in your mouth, not in your hands.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, you got to tell Howard, uh, to add another "M" to the firm - 'cause it'll make it more symmetrical.<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
 And people love symmetricality.<br/>
<br/>
 - I can't argue with that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
 Come on, J Sit Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 - That'll do.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's why God gave us two eyes - Oh?<br/>
<br/>
 You know, more pleasant to look at.<br/>
<br/>
 Hands and two feet, thumbs and nipples.<br/>
<br/>
 We could get by with one nipple.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
 You may be more right about this than anything you've ever spoken about before.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 Four or six nipples it's interesting, but I submit to the court it's, uh it's overkill.<br/>
<br/>
 H-H-M-M.<br/>
<br/>
 "Hmmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
 " See?<br/>
<br/>
 That's better.<br/>
<br/>
 H-H-M is just "Hmph.<br/>
<br/>
 " - No?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 You're writing this down.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, I-I put a trash can by the bed just in case, you know, - in the eventuality - You think of everything.<br/>
<br/>
 You're very smart, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 And there's some water here for you, too.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 What do you feel like in the morning - eggs or pancakes?<br/>
<br/>
 - Pancakes.<br/>
<br/>
 Make those pancakes you make.<br/>
<br/>
 - Pancakes it is.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Get some rest, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 You've had a big day.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 A big day.<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 - Good night, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 - Good night.<br/>
<br/>
 The winner takes it all The loser has to fall Besi - Beside the victory - Victory - That's her destin - That's her destiny I was in your arms Thinking I belonged there - I figured it - It was - It made sense - Sense Building me a fence Building me a home Thinking I'd be strong there But I was a fool Playing by the rules He's got a three-and-a-half-hour jump on us, but he started out on foot, which gives us a fighting chance.<br/>
<br/>
 He doesn't have his passport, so he's probably not headed to the airport.<br/>
<br/>
 Doesn't know his way around town, but if he gets to a bus or a taxi, that's not gonna matter much.<br/>
<br/>
 Most likely ran off towards the highway.<br/>
<br/>
 You two, head north and south, see if he's got his thumb out.<br/>
<br/>
 You two, go to the train and bus stations and use the cover story.<br/>
<br/>
 You, you stay with the crew, - you keep them on lockdown.<br/>
<br/>
 - You got it.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, um, I need the number for Travel Wire.<br/>
<br/>
 Just connect me.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 I was, uh, wondering if you could help me.<br/>
<br/>
 I arranged for my wife to wire me money from Frankfurt, Germany, to the U.<br/>
<br/>
 S.<br/>
<br/>
 The problem is, she didn't tell me which branch.<br/>
<br/>
 Margarethe Ziegler.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 A-Albuquerque branch on Fourth.<br/>
<br/>
 I should have known.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 Watermelon, pickles.<br/>
<br/>
 Watermelon, pickles.<br/>

 Watermelon, pickles.<br/>
<br/>
 One-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 It's very nice of you to come.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course.<br/>
<br/>
 You are Chuck's brother?<br/>
<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 - Ken.<br/>
<br/>
 Greenfield.<br/>
<br/>
 This is Emily Reed.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 We knew Chuck back in our time with the Native Peoples Education Council.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 I remember.<br/>
<br/>
 He spoke of you both quite fondly.<br/>
<br/>
 That means a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 I feel bad we lost touch for so long.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you're here today, so We saw the notice about - the law library dedication this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 And today was the anniversary of I can't believe it's been a year.<br/>
<br/>
 It still doesn't make any sense.<br/>
<br/>
 Well So nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 - God bless.<br/>
<br/>
 - Bless you.<br/>
<br/>
 Very thoughtful.<br/>
<br/>
 Boo-hoo-hoo.<br/>
<br/>
 Boo-hoo.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 - You need some water?<br/>
<br/>
 - Coffee.<br/>
<br/>
 And give me one of these bear claws, please.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 You better pace yourself, though.<br/>
<br/>
 It's gonna be a long day.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 But, hey, we got customers already.<br/>
<br/>
 That's a good sign.<br/>
<br/>
 I was afraid no one would show up.<br/>
<br/>
 How'd it look?<br/>
<br/>
 How'd it feel?<br/>
<br/>
 Felt like I looked sad.<br/>
<br/>
 What's the headstone like?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, Howard picked the big one.<br/>
<br/>
 But it's tasteful.<br/>
<br/>
 Hermoso cariÃ±o Hermoso cariÃ±o Estoy como un niÃ±o Con nuevo jugete Contento y feliz All right, just sign right there at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Then we give you This is your receipt.<br/>
<br/>
 Just make sure your party has valid I. D.<br/>
<br/>
 when they pick up.<br/>
<br/>
 - Anything else?<br/>
<br/>
 - No.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Have a good day.<br/>
<br/>
 Can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 It'd be wonderful if you could.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm, uh, looking for a Werner Ziegler.<br/>
<br/>
 Has he been in here in the last few hours?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm s I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Even if he was here, it's not company policy to give out customer information.<br/>
<br/>
 Even if he just walked in?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't care about what he did.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I really can't.<br/>
<br/>
 He is my brother-in-law, and we're very worried about him.<br/>
<br/>
 He has early stage dementia, and on top of that, he's a diabetic.<br/>
<br/>
 He doesn't have his medicine, and my wife is beside herself.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, W-We talked long-distance to their sister, Margarethe, back in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
 She said Werner called ranting and raving, wanting her to send money, and, well, she said she did, to this branch.<br/>
<br/>
 I have his insulin in a cooler out in the car, and I was hoping I would get here ahead of him.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, yeah, he was here, but you missed him.<br/>
<br/>
 He left about an hour ago.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
 Damn.<br/>
<br/>
 Just took the money and left?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, not right away.<br/>
<br/>
 He made a couple calls on the pay phone, picked up his money, then left.<br/>
<br/>
 And, what, just wandered off on foot?<br/>
<br/>
 He got in a car.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, I think one of his calls was for a cab.<br/>
<br/>
 You see what company?<br/>
<br/>
 - Was it a regular taxi, car service?<br/>
<br/>
 - I didn't.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 Any chance that that I might have a a peek at your security video, see who got him?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 I get it.<br/>
<br/>
 Not company policy.<br/>
<br/>
 Then could you tell me where the nearest hospital is?<br/>
<br/>
 He was here a good half-hour or so before his money order came through.<br/>
<br/>
 He asked if his money came, but not yet.<br/>
<br/>
 - You mind?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, that's bad luck.<br/>
<br/>
 - You can't see the car.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks for your help.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
 Hope you find him.<br/>
<br/>
 Can I see it?<br/>
<br/>
 For what it's worth, I believe him.<br/>
<br/>
 He said he'd be gone four days.<br/>
<br/>
 He's not going to any cops.<br/>
<br/>
 This is about him wanting to see his wife, plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
 She's on a Lufthansa flight.<br/>
<br/>
 Landing in Denver nine hours from now.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 And your men will be there.<br/>
<br/>
 And they'll follow her from the airport to wherever he's holed up.<br/>
<br/>
 And then?<br/>
<br/>
 There's another way to play this.<br/>
<br/>
 If I can find him before the wife gets here, let me bring him in and finish what he started.<br/>
<br/>
 His crew can't do it without him.<br/>
<br/>
 If Ziegler disappears, you are left with the most expensive hole in the ground this side of the Mississippi.<br/>
<br/>
 You can find him?<br/>
<br/>
 This is on me.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll fix it.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 You get everybody back in.<br/>
<br/>
 Get them on the phone to every cab company and car service.<br/>
<br/>
 You make up a story.<br/>
<br/>
 Find out who picked Ziegler up at the Travel Wire on Fourth.<br/>
<br/>
 And start calling hotels here, Colorado, Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
 He had to register under his own name or his wife's.<br/>
<br/>
 Pull the transcript on the last call to his wife.<br/>
<br/>
 Read it to me.<br/>
<br/>
 What'd they talk about?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 After that.<br/>
<br/>
 After the dog.<br/>
<br/>
 They were gonna go on vacation.<br/>
<br/>
 Baden-Baden.<br/>
<br/>
 Natural springs.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, there.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you find your brother-in-law?<br/>
<br/>
 Is he okay?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, I'm calling for one of your guests.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, Werner Ziegler.<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
 Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.<br/>
<br/>
 You're sure?<br/>
<br/>
 And there's no reservation under that name?<br/>
<br/>
 Con el amo De la plaza Hay Que tener mÃ¡s cuidado Porque lo ven muy tranquilo I won't lie.<br/>
<br/>
 It's been a tough year.<br/>
<br/>
 But I'm proud to say Hamlin Hamlin McGill is back and going strong.<br/>
<br/>
 It's his lasting legacy, which is why this couldn't be more appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
 I know this would have meant the world to him a good and proper memorial for a man who was many things, but always a lawyer first.<br/>
<br/>
 On behalf of the whole school, we want to thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 Me?<br/>
<br/>
 No, I didn't donate any of this.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm just a guest.<br/>
<br/>
 Really?<br/>
<br/>
 Dude, I'm pretty sure I heard someone say - you paid for all of it.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I didn't.<br/>
<br/>
 I wish I could take credit for it, but I can't.<br/>
<br/>
 The invitation says "anonymous donor.<br/>
<br/>
 " I assumed that meant HHM.<br/>
<br/>
 Huh.<br/>
<br/>
 - Baked Brie?<br/>
<br/>
 - Don't mind if I do.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually, I happen to know Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 James McGill paid for the reading room himself.<br/>
<br/>
 Really?<br/>
<br/>
 The brother did this?<br/>
<br/>
 I saw him write the check.<br/>
<br/>
 How much do you think this cost?<br/>
<br/>
 - Hi, Rich.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 This is quite an event.<br/>
<br/>
 Looks like half the attorneys in the southwest are here.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 - They all came for Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 I heard someone say that Jimmy paid for all this himself?<br/>
<br/>
 He'd prefer to remain anonymous.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, where is he?<br/>
<br/>
 I was hoping to say hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, he's around here somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Isn't that him out there?<br/>
<br/>
 Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess even a year out, an event like this can be tough.<br/>
<br/>
 I better go check on him.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thanks for coming, Rich.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 It's almost time to go back in.<br/>
<br/>
 $23,000.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't believe I wrote a $23,000 check for this.<br/>
<br/>
 You know?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't even see anyone from the bar association in there.<br/>
<br/>
 We still have almost a week.<br/>
<br/>
 Someone on the board will hear about this, and they'll believe it because they heard it from a colleague.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
 Word gets around, but Try this on for size.<br/>
<br/>
 Judge Papadoumian is in her chambers.<br/>
<br/>
 She's working late.<br/>
<br/>
 Everyone else has gone home.<br/>
<br/>
 Suddenly, she smells something, something burning.<br/>
<br/>
 She crosses to her door.<br/>
<br/>
 It's warm to the touch.<br/>
<br/>
 She opens it.<br/>
<br/>
 Whoosh!<br/>
<br/>
 Wall of flames.<br/>
<br/>
 Her clerk's chamber's on fire.<br/>
<br/>
 And she's trapped.<br/>
<br/>
 But then, through the fire and smoke, a figure emerges.<br/>
<br/>
 It's Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 See, I rescue a judge.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, that, people are gonna talk about.<br/>
<br/>
 And it's it's too big, and probably it's not how I come back from "insincere.<br/>
<br/>
 " Right.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Wanna go back in, get your money's worth?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm starving.<br/>
<br/>
 Those little hamburgers are looking good.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm allowed to pay for the food, but I'm too sad to eat.<br/>
<br/>
 Z-I-E-G-L-E-R.<br/>
<br/>
 He is?<br/>
<br/>
 You don't know if he's on the property at the moment?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No, I don't need to talk to him right now.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No message.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 You have a nice day.<br/>
<br/>
 Get out of the way!<br/>
<br/>
 Go!<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just not working.<br/>
<br/>
 - Excuse me.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hello?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 And the machine is stuck.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Unless there's any additional questions?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, uh, did they all get the - Yes, they did.<br/>
<br/>
 - Great.<br/>
<br/>
 - Thank them again before leaving.<br/>
<br/>
 - Of course.<br/>
<br/>
 Here's where we are Raymond Chin six votes, Duncan Springer six votes, Marcie Ramirez five votes, Franklyn Pickett, Teodora Moon, and Tristram Bolger three votes each, and Kristy Esposito one vote.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, looks like we have three scholarships to give and three front runners.<br/>
<br/>
 So, unless there's any disagreement, I think we can Uh, Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, the one vote for Kristy Esposito?<br/>
<br/>
 That was me.<br/>
<br/>
 And for what it's worth, I-I think we should give her another look.<br/>
<br/>
 Esposito?<br/>
<br/>
 That's the shoplifter?<br/>
<br/>
 The shoplifter.<br/>
<br/>
 Ya That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, her grades are good.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe not quite as good as some of the other kids, but they're good.<br/>
<br/>
 And her recommendations are solid.<br/>
<br/>
 And, yeah, she's had some trouble, but, um, she was new in town, and she made some bad choices.<br/>
<br/>
 And that was sophomore year.<br/>
<br/>
 She's had two really strong years since then.<br/>
<br/>
 And have you all read this?<br/>
<br/>
 Her essay is well, that experience is what got her interested in the law.<br/>
<br/>
 And it's really good.<br/>
<br/>
 It's really good.<br/>
<br/>
 And my point is that maybe someone who's been in trouble, someone who doesn't have a perfect record, you know, who's made mistakes and faced the consequences maybe she brings something that the others don't.<br/>
<br/>
 I think that deserves real consideration.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, you make a hell of an argument.<br/>
<br/>
 How about we take another vote?<br/>
<br/>
 Kristy!<br/>
<br/>
 Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Esposito, hold up!<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 We met inside.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 You didn't get it.<br/>
<br/>
 You were never gonna get it.<br/>
<br/>
 They They dangle these things in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
 They tell you, you got a chance, but I'm sorry it's a lie because they had already made up their mind and they knew what they were gonna do before you walked in the door.<br/>
<br/>
 You made a mistake, and they are never forgetting it.<br/>
<br/>
 As far as they're concerned, your mistake is just it's who you are, and it's all you are.<br/>
<br/>
 And I'm not just talking about the scholarship here.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm talking about everything.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, they'll smile at you, they'll pat you on the head, but they are never, ever letting you in.<br/>
<br/>
 But listen.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen.<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn't because you don't need them.<br/>
<br/>
 They're not gonna give it to you?<br/>
<br/>
 So what?<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna take it.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna do whatever it takes.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you hear me?<br/>
<br/>
 You are not gonna play by the rules.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna go your own way.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna do what they won't do.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna be smart.<br/>
<br/>
 You are gonna cut corners, and you are gonna win.<br/>
<br/>
 They're on the 35th floor?<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna be on the 50th floor.<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna be looking down on them.<br/>
<br/>
 And the higher you rise, the more they're gonna hate you.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 You rub their noses in it.<br/>
<br/>
 You make them suffer.<br/>
<br/>
 You don't matter all that much to them.<br/>
<br/>
 So what?<br/>
<br/>
 So what?<br/>
<br/>
 Screw them.<br/>
<br/>
 Remember the winner takes it all.<br/>
<br/>
 I've gotta go get my bus.<br/>
<br/>
 You You understand what I'm trying to tell you, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 I think I do.<br/>
<br/>
 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 All right, go get 'em.<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 God damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 Damn it!<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 - Can I help you?<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, my friend was here earlier, um, bald fellow, about so tall.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Did, uh, they find his brother-in-law?<br/>
<br/>
 Is he okay?<br/>
<br/>
 No, no.<br/>
<br/>
 No, we haven't found him yet.<br/>
<br/>
 We're really worried.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm sorry to hear about that.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 So, I was wondering if there's maybe something that, you know, my friend missed.<br/>
<br/>
 I showed him everything I've got.<br/>
<br/>
 Show me what you showed him.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe you should just call your friend.<br/>
<br/>
 I did, and, you know, he told me to come back and take another look.<br/>
<br/>
 I I'd really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 You better just call the police.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure, sure.<br/>

 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 This is Werner?<br/>

<br/>
 I'm calling on behalf of Gustavo Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 I see.<br/>
<br/>
 Is Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring very upset?<br/>
<br/>
 What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
 Please let him know the work will continue.<br/>
<br/>
 Did Michael show him my letter?<br/>
<br/>
 I explained everything.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, no, Michael hasn't shared that with Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 The letter has specific instructions.<br/>
<br/>
 My men will be able to continue a few days without me.<br/>
<br/>
 The work will go on.<br/>
<br/>
 Ask Michael.<br/>
<br/>
 Michael.<br/>
<br/>
 Michael's very busy, and he asked me to speak with you.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you remember what your instructions were?<br/>
<br/>
 Certainly.<br/>
<br/>
 They are to finish clearing the debris, then begin the south wall.<br/>
<br/>
 That's the south wall?<br/>
<br/>
 The south wall, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 The concrete is standing by.<br/>
<br/>
 They can start pouring.<br/>
<br/>
 It's very straightforward, so Kai will kno The "concrete form"?<br/>

<br/>
 Michael I don't wanna hear another damn word out of you.<br/>
<br/>
 Go.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 - I think I got something here.<br/>
<br/>
 Take a look.<br/>
<br/>
 The problem might have been starting with "Remorse," so I'm trying to work into it more gradually.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, "The Law," "Plans," then "Remorse," then "Brother," then "Legacy.<br/>
<br/>
 " What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
 Everything okay?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 How'd it go?<br/>
<br/>
 We gave three very bright young people scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 All right, we can work on this.<br/>
<br/>
 I know it's a lot, but this is one time you do not want to wing it.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, the hard part's done.<br/>
<br/>
 Reading room, scholarship, cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
 By now, they've got to have heard about some of it.<br/>
<br/>
 We set up the dominoes, and now you just knock them down.<br/>
<br/>
 I can say whatever I want.<br/>
<br/>
 To the board, I'm still that guy.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, you got to say something.<br/>
<br/>
 What if, uh What if, um What if Chuck does the talking for me?<br/>
<br/>
 Wait here.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes?<br/>
<br/>
 - I got him.<br/>
<br/>
 Where are you now?<br/>
<br/>
 Out by an old raceway off 55, about 8 miles north of San Ysidro.<br/>
<br/>
 Where was he?<br/>
<br/>
 A place called Dulce Vega Hot Springs up in Jemez.<br/>
<br/>
 It's got to be where his wife is headed.<br/>
<br/>
 Something else.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes?<br/>
<br/>
 When I found him, he was on the phone with an interested party pretending to be one of your guys.<br/>
<br/>
 What did he tell them?<br/>
<br/>
 Nothing useful.<br/>
<br/>
 - You're certain?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 You have any idea who it was?<br/>
<br/>
 I do.<br/>
<br/>
 All right, I'll bring him in now.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Keep him there.<br/>
<br/>
 Wait.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd go another way.<br/>
<br/>
 That I know.<br/>
<br/>
 That'd be a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
 This discussion serves no purpose.<br/>
<br/>
 Wait where you are.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll take care of it.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 God damn it.<br/>
<br/>
 Get out.<br/>
<br/>
 I want to know what your end game was.<br/>
<br/>
 What did you think was gonna happen?<br/>
<br/>
 I thought I would come back and my friend Michael would be very, very angry, but in time, he would understand and forgive.<br/>
<br/>
 It was never up to me.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, Michael, look.<br/>
<br/>
 I know I've made trouble for you, and I'm very sorry for the damage I caused.<br/>
<br/>
 I will repair what I broke with my own hands, but, please, Margarethe will land any minute.<br/>
<br/>
 Soon, she will be at the motel.<br/>
<br/>
 Please take me back there.<br/>
<br/>
 Let us be together for a little, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Let her see me and know everything is okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah, please, Michael.<br/>
<br/>
 I go back now, I go back in the morning what difference can it make?<br/>
<br/>
 It's not gonna happen.<br/>
<br/>
 Let me speak to Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 I will explain everything.<br/>
<br/>
 I will make him understand.<br/>
<br/>
 You're not gonna talk to Fring.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, please.<br/>
<br/>
 I know if I Werner, nothing you can say or do will make anyone trust you again.<br/>
<br/>
 I will go home.<br/>
<br/>
 I will never breathe a word of this ever.<br/>
<br/>
 The money I give all of it back.<br/>
<br/>
 I will tell no one.<br/>
<br/>
 I s-swear.<br/>
<br/>
 It will be as if none of this ever happened.<br/>
<br/>
 Please, Michael.<br/>
<br/>
 You know I will keep silent.<br/>
<br/>
 You know it.<br/>
<br/>
 Please.<br/>
<br/>
 Does your wife have a cellphone with her?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 I need you to call her now.<br/>
<br/>
 She landed an hour ago.<br/>
<br/>
 But she knows nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 And you need to keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
 She's being followed.<br/>
<br/>
 She's followed?<br/>
<br/>
 She goes back to the airport, nothing will happen to her.<br/>
<br/>
 Surely they could not they would not Hey, pull yourself together.<br/>
<br/>
 Give me the phone.<br/>
<br/>
 I call her now.<br/>
<br/>
 - Calm Calm Dow <br/>
<br/>
 - Give it to me.<br/>
<br/>
 Calm down!<br/>
<br/>
 She can't suspect.<br/>
<br/>
 It doesn't matter what you tell her, as long as she goes back where she belongs.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Ja.<br/>
<br/>
 Will she do it?<br/>
<br/>
 She was very angry, but, yes, she will go home.<br/>
<br/>
 Michael if she does not hear a word from me, she will ask questions.<br/>
<br/>
 She will go to the police.<br/>
<br/>
 There will be a story, an accident.<br/>
<br/>
 Lawyers will visit, German lawyers.<br/>
<br/>
 Her questions will be answered.<br/>
<br/>
 This you swear?<br/>
<br/>
 This I swear.<br/>
<br/>
 And my men?<br/>
<br/>
 They're going home.<br/>
<br/>
 They'll be okay.<br/>
<br/>
 They're trusted.<br/>
<br/>
 Is there no other way, truly?<br/>
<br/>
 There are so many stars visible in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
 I will walk out there to get a better look.<br/>
<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean it's incredible.<br/>
<br/>
 I feel like we've been talking about this forever, and now here it is.<br/>
<br/>
 An architectural feat.<br/>
<br/>
 Truly.<br/>
<br/>
 Herculean.<br/>
<br/>
 This is This is Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
 I can work with this.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, it's not exactly what we talked about, but it has possibilities, even unfinished.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, ventilation at this point is the main hurdle, but with a series of fans and the right equipment, I am certain that I could do a rudimentary cook at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
 Not until it is ready.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, of course.<br/>
<br/>
 We only want to do it if it's done right.<br/>
<br/>
 I was just exploring possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
 I am gonna go up and check the Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course.<br/>
<br/>
 That won't be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
 Where do you have it?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 This should do it.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck wrote a good letter, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck wrote a great letter.<br/>
<br/>
 It's not just the words, though, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 It's how you read them.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, whatever happens in there I'm with you.<br/>
<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill, we've reviewed all the facts, the same facts as the hearing committee.<br/>
<br/>
 We've evaluated their findings.<br/>
<br/>
 All that's left is for us to hear your prepared statement.<br/>
<br/>
 So, whenever you're ready.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Your Honor.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I don't have a prepared statement.<br/>
<br/>
 But I do have this.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, it's a letter from my brother, Charles McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 He left it to me in his will, and I received it last year after he passed.<br/>
<br/>
 "Dear Jimmy, I have left many things unsaid in our relationship through the years.<br/>
<br/>
 Rather than allow these unspoken thoughts to die with me, I've chosen to record them here for you.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope you will take my words in the spirit in which they are intended.<br/>
<br/>
 I remember quite clearly the day you came home from the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't imagine the joy on Mom's face.<br/>
<br/>
 I can honestly say I never saw her happier.<br/>
<br/>
 " I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I can't do this.<br/>
<br/>
 I was I was just gonna try to I was gonna try to move you all with my brother's eloquent words, you know, pull on your heartstrings, but it's not right.<br/>
<br/>
 This letter's between me and him, and it should stay that way.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, my brother, Chuck you you knew him.<br/>
<br/>
 He loved me in his own way.<br/>
<br/>
 He loved me as a brother.<br/>
<br/>
 He did not love me as a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 Big reason I became a lawyer was Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 He was the most brilliant man I ever knew.<br/>
<br/>
 And an incredible lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 You know?<br/>
<br/>
 And, uh, he knew exactly who he was exactly.<br/>
<br/>
 And all my life, I wanted to make him proud.<br/>
<br/>
 And he was not an easy man to make proud, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 Like climbing Everest without supplies.<br/>
<br/>
 If you were one of the lucky few who reached that peak, even for a moment, if you made him proud, wow, what a feeling.<br/>
<br/>
 Whew.<br/>
<br/>
 And he let you know it, too.<br/>
<br/>
 But if you weren't one of those people he was polite enough, but he did not suffer fools, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 And he could be judgmental and difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 And he knew how to get under your skin.<br/>
<br/>
 And could be a real son of a b*tch.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck was the one who was always right always.<br/>
<br/>
 And usually he was.<br/>
<br/>
 You know?<br/>
<br/>
 So, for a guy like me I did lousy in school.<br/>
<br/>
 I lacked ambition.<br/>
<br/>
 I always cut corners.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, for me to live up to the standards of Charles McGill I mean, look at me.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll never be as moral as him.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll never be as smart.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll never be as respected.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll never be as good as Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 But I can try.<br/>
<br/>
 I can try.<br/>
<br/>
 If you decide, and I get to be a lawyer I'll do everything in my power to be worthy of the name McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 And if you decide I'm not a lawyer doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll still try to be the best man that I can be.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm lucky.<br/>
<br/>
 I got this letter.<br/>
<br/>
 I never had a chance to write him a letter and to tell him all the things that I should have.<br/>
<br/>
 And I got to believe that somehow somehow he knows.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, that's That'll have to do it for me.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 I knew you could do it!<br/>
<br/>
 I knew you had it in you.<br/>
<br/>
 - That was so great.<br/>
<br/>
 - I mean, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 They They have to reinstate you, right?<br/>
<br/>
 - They just have to.<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you see those suckers?<br/>
<br/>
 That one assh*le was crying.<br/>
<br/>
 He had actual tears!<br/>
<br/>
 Jesus, Kim!<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, I started reading the letter, and I just knew it wasn't I could tell by their faces it wasn't gonna be enough, right?<br/>
<br/>
 So I just went off on this flow, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 I had this energy going through me.<br/>
<br/>
 It was like improv or jazz, and then boom!<br/>
<br/>
 I sunk the hook in!<br/>
<br/>
 I am so lucky I have this letter.<br/>
<br/>
 God, I could see the Matrix, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 I was invincible.<br/>
<br/>
 I could dodge b*ll*ts, baby.<br/>
<br/>
 And you were right.<br/>
<br/>
 You were right.<br/>
<br/>
 It was all about Chuck the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, Mr. McGill, you're still here.<br/>
<br/>
 There's some good news.<br/>
<br/>
 - Believe me, I already know.<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, good.<br/>
<br/>
 Then if you want to come with me to the office, there's some paperwork for you to sign.<br/>
<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's do this thing.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, and, sweetheart, I'm gonna need one more form a DBA because I'm not gonna be practicing under the name McGill, so Shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
 Just down the hall, we have all the forms.<br/>
<br/>
 - Great.<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 - Wait.<br/>
<br/>
 Wh Wait.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, Jimmy, what?<br/>
<br/>
 S'all good, man.</div>
