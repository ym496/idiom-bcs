<div class="content">Previously on AMC's Better Call Saul Should I settle?<br/>
<br/>
 Hector Salamanca.<br/>
<br/>
 - Turn the lights on.<br/>
<br/>
 - I'm back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
 You'd rather tear down HHM than retire.<br/>
<br/>
 You think I'm trouble now?<br/>
<br/>
 Imagine me as your enemy.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim: It's a new client, and if I mess this up, it's a former client.<br/>
<br/>
 Sandpiper is settling.<br/>
<br/>
 This is the solution to everything!<br/>
<br/>
 I'll be back in a few hours.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Young Chuck: "It was very still except for the tree-toads and the frogs in the brook peeping mournfully, and every little while Mabel could hear strange rustlings in the leaves.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Dog barking in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 - She tried to remember the way home, but the woods looked so different now that she couldn't think which way to go.<br/>
<br/>
 She began to be frightened.<br/>
<br/>
 'What's that?<br/>
<br/>
' said Mabel.<br/>
<br/>
 'Oh, I'm I'm so frightened!<br/>
<br/>
' In a minute or two she heard the howl again 'O-o-o-w!<br/>
<br/>
' a long, wild cry.<br/>
<br/>
 She began to run, but the poor thing had lost her way.<br/>
<br/>
 " Is she gonna be okay?<br/>
<br/>
 - She'll be fine, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 - How do you know?<br/>
<br/>
 Just listen.<br/>
<br/>
 You'll see.<br/>
<br/>
 [Gas hissing]<br/>
<br/>
 "It was so dark that she stumbled over the bushes and the roots of the trees" [Telephone ringing]<br/>

 Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I know.<br/>
<br/>
 Does she need to spend the night?<br/>
<br/>
 Tech: Once this is done, she'll be discharged.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 [Indistinct talking in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 [Indistinct talking on P. A. ]<br/>
<br/>
 [Wind howling, papers rustling]<br/>
<br/>
 Lawsuits.<br/>
<br/>
 Threats.<br/>
<br/>
 Recriminations.<br/>
<br/>
 This is a situation no firm ever wants to be in.<br/>
<br/>
 It's well, it's embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I know we all want a swift resolution here.<br/>
<br/>
 So what are our options?<br/>
<br/>
 Take it to trial.<br/>
<br/>
 Expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 And extremely damaging for HHM's reputation.<br/>
<br/>
 Not my first choice or yours, I imagine.<br/>
<br/>
 The firm could choose to buy me out for an amount that is almost certain to bankrupt it.<br/>
<br/>
 I spent decades building this firm.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't want to be the agent of its destruction.<br/>
<br/>
 There is a third option.<br/>
<br/>
 There's no reason we can't put all this unpleasantness behind us and continue on as we have been.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<br/>
<br/>
 And if you agree, I think we can settle all this right now with a simple handshake.<br/>
<br/>
 Would you all give us the room for a moment?<br/>
<br/>
 [Door opens]<br/>
<br/>
 [Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
 17 years.<br/>
<br/>
 18 in July, actually.<br/>
<br/>
 All those years we built this place together.<br/>
<br/>
 And all that time I've supported you.<br/>
<br/>
 Looked up to you, deferred to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<br/>
<br/>
 I have Mnh.<br/>
<br/>
 You did.<br/>
<br/>
 For a long time.<br/>
<br/>
 But you've let personal vendettas turn your focus away from what's best for HHM.<br/>
<br/>
 You've put your needs first.<br/>
<br/>
 - To our detriment.<br/>
<br/>
 - I don't think that's accurate.<br/>
<br/>
 And the moment that I mildly suggest, with empathy and concern, that maybe it's time for you to consider retirement the first instinct you have is to sue me?!<br/>
<br/>
 To sue the firm?<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I I-I don't even know I-In what world is that anything but the deepest betrayal of everything we worked so hard to accomplish?<br/>
<br/>
 In what world is that anything but the deepest betrayal of our friendship?<br/>
<br/>
 Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 I could argue that you're the one who betrayed me.<br/>
<br/>
 That's bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
 And you know it.<br/>
<br/>
 This is pointless.<br/>
<br/>
 Here.<br/>
<br/>
 Just take this.<br/>
<br/>
 [Paper rustles]<br/>
<br/>
 $3 million?<br/>
<br/>
 The first of three payments, as per the partnership agreement.<br/>
<br/>
 The firm can't afford this.<br/>
<br/>
 Are you You're not shutting down, are you?<br/>
<br/>
 I would never endanger the firm.<br/>
<br/>
 This is mostly from my personal funds.<br/>
<br/>
 And a few loans.<br/>
<br/>
 You're paying me out of your own pocket.<br/>
<br/>
 You won.<br/>
<br/>
 Hamlin: There's one last thing [Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Hamlin: Everybody!<br/>
<br/>
 [Conversations stop]<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you for gathering.<br/>
<br/>
 I have some bittersweet news to share.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry to say, but our fearless leader, Charles McGill, will be leaving HHM.<br/>
<br/>
 Effective immediately.<br/>
<br/>
 I wanted to take this moment to thank Chuck for everything he's done for HHM.<br/>
<br/>
 We started off with six employees.<br/>
<br/>
 And Chuck helped grow us into one of the largest firms in the state.<br/>
<br/>
 We will be forever grateful for his dedication.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have anything you want to say?<br/>
<br/>
 Alright, then.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's give him a hand!<br/>
<br/>
 [Applause]<br/>
<br/>
 [Indistinct talking]<br/>
<br/>
 [Applause continues]<br/>
<br/>
 [Birds chirping]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles passing]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 [Grunts softly]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Morning.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Close.<br/>
<br/>
 Gatorade.<br/>
<br/>
 You need electrolytes.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 You hungry?<br/>
<br/>
 I'll make you somethin'.<br/>
<br/>
 Be right back.<br/>
<br/>
 Just finish that.<br/>
<br/>
 [Footsteps depart]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sizzling]<br/>
<br/>
 Kim: Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 I said I'd bring it to you.<br/>
<br/>
 I needed to stretch my legs.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Sit.<br/>
<br/>
 Eggs.<br/>
<br/>
 This is, uh, twisted.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 This one-handed crap is gonna get real old, real fast.<br/>
<br/>
 Is there coffee?<br/>
<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
<br/>
 But, uh, more Gatorade first.<br/>
<br/>
 [Pan thuds lightly]<br/>
<br/>
 [Silverware clatters lightly]<br/>
<br/>
 Alright, your, uh, two options are good ole' ibuprofen which, uh, you know, should take the edge off.<br/>
<br/>
 Or the proverbial "good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 " [Pills rattle]<br/>
<br/>
 The answer is always "the good stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 " Right.<br/>
<br/>
 But food first.<br/>
<br/>
 [Bottle thuds]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
 You're not feeding me, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 There are lines we do not cross.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 I was looking into our lease on the office.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, we'd definitely take a haircut if we broke it.<br/>
<br/>
 But we are allowed to sublet.<br/>
<br/>
 Might be our best option.<br/>
<br/>
 Furniture's mostly rented month to month.<br/>
<br/>
 So that's not an issue.<br/>
<br/>
 For you, I think you need a desk, some file cabinets.<br/>
<br/>
 A Westlaw terminal And, uh, haven't figured out Francesca yet.<br/>
<br/>
 That's another conversation.<br/>
<br/>
 All that sound okay?<br/>
<br/>
 Are you sure about this?<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, even with the Sandpiper money?<br/>
<br/>
 Look.<br/>
<br/>
 After, uh everything [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I don't give a shit about the office.<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathes deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 So can I start looking for a tenant?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 [Fork clinking]<br/>
<br/>
 I could've k*lled someone, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 I worked most of last week on maybe six hours of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
 And then I I crossed three lanes of traffic, and I don't remember any of it Look, you were just doing what you thought you had to do.<br/>
<br/>
 - Because of me.<br/>
<br/>
 - You didn't make me get in that car.<br/>
<br/>
 That was all me.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm an adult.<br/>
<br/>
 I made a choice.<br/>
<br/>
 [Fork tapping]<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 All I can say is, I am gonna fix things.<br/>
<br/>
 [Fork tapping]<br/>
<br/>
 [Car door creaks]<br/>

 [Dog barking in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 [Car door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 Nacho: Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 So, we're gonna do everything around back.<br/>
<br/>
 It's mostly commercial around here, so it's quiet at night.<br/>
<br/>
 - ["Dinero Sucio" plays on radio]<br/>
<br/>
 - We pull the trucks up to the doors.<br/>
<br/>
 We unload right into the shop.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sewing machine whirring]<br/>
<br/>
 We can break down the stuff in here.<br/>
<br/>
 There's space in the back for storing scales and, uh, supplies when the shop's open.<br/>
<br/>
 Should be able to process everything overnight.<br/>
<br/>
 I'd be here to see it gets done right Where's, uh, Papi?<br/>
<br/>
 I'll be taking care of all this.<br/>
<br/>
 But he's good.<br/>
<br/>
 Once we get everything packed, Arturo will pick up and supervise distro, uh, make sure everything is clear.<br/>
<br/>
 Here's Papi!<br/>
<br/>
 Ah.<br/>
<br/>
 [Knocking, whirring]<br/>
<br/>
 Don Hector [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 [Money rustles]<br/>
<br/>
 Mm?<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Nacho: PapÃ¡ [Vehicles passing in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door closes, sound of passing vehicles fades]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door opens]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles passing in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 He's old-fashioned.<br/>
<br/>
 He'll come around.<br/>
<br/>
 [Dog barking in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 Don Hector.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll talk to him.<br/>
<br/>
 He'll come around.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't trust him.<br/>
<br/>
 [Door creaks]<br/>
<br/>
 These are from Kevin and Paige.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I guess they're from everybody at Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh!<br/>
<br/>
 And there's a card.<br/>
<br/>
 Somewhere in here.<br/>
<br/>
 Ah, here!<br/>
<br/>
 You brought the book?<br/>
<br/>
 Um, sure.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Mr. Gatwood.<br/>
<br/>
 The card wasn't clear, but I'm pretty sure you're getting steaks, too.<br/>
<br/>
 Really?<br/>
<br/>
 Texas.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 He wishes you a speedy recovery.<br/>
<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 You are so lucky.<br/>
<br/>
 I, um, I used to drive that highway every weekend to visit my brother and his kids, and I saw an accident almost every single time.<br/>
<br/>
 People die on that road all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I already rescheduled everything you had this week.<br/>
<br/>
 But I didn't touch that meeting with the regulator.<br/>
<br/>
 I know that whole Utah timeline is delicate, so Right.<br/>
<br/>
 It's next Wednesday, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 And there's still a lot of prep that we pushed so you could focus on getting Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Gatwood up by the end of the quarter.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
 Which isn't happening now.<br/>
<br/>
 Actually?<br/>
<br/>
 I talked with Colleen, and she said everyone's fine doing that meeting Monday.<br/>
<br/>
 So, you know, that means we could still slide in just under the deadline [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
 Uh.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you bring a breakdown of the documents I'll need for next Wednesday?<br/>
<br/>
 I would I would have to figure out Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 how long that'll take me.<br/>
<br/>
 Right.<br/>
<br/>
 [Papers rustling]<br/>
<br/>
 That's four, six.<br/>
<br/>
 Go to 11.<br/>
<br/>
 [Papers rustling]<br/>
<br/>
 Found it.<br/>
<br/>
 Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
 And Paige's timeline's on the top.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim?<br/>
<br/>
 Y-You okay?<br/>
<br/>
 I-I can always come back I'm gonna need you to cancel Gatwood and push everything else.<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 E-Everything?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Everything.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Book closes]<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 But first, could you give me a ride?<br/>
<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 Where to?<br/>
<br/>
 [Little L plays in background]<br/>
<br/>
 Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Wexler sends her apologies, Mr. Gatwood.<br/>
<br/>
 A-And she feels terrible about this, but with her accident and the recovery she's just not gonna be able to finish her work for you in time.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, of course, I'll tell her.<br/>
<br/>
 A-And again, she is very sorry, and I know she'll be giving you a call herself soon.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, yes.<br/>
<br/>
 Ms. Wexler did ask me to tell you she strongly recommends Schweikart and Cokely.<br/>
<br/>
 They're an exceptional firm.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I will send that info over today.<br/>
<br/>
 A-And Ms. W-Wexler will follow up herself shortly.<br/>
<br/>
 "Thanks for the meat.<br/>
<br/>
 " Uh.<br/>
<br/>
 A-And she says thank you for the steaks.<br/>
<br/>
 She's so excited to fire up that grill.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 B-Bye!<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 How many do I have?<br/>
<br/>
 Nine Good.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 [Keys jingling]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Knock on door]<br/>
<br/>
 - It's Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 I know you don't wanna see me, but, uh, I just want to know you're okay.<br/>
<br/>
 C'mon, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 I just want to see your face.<br/>
<br/>
 C'mon, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 I just need a minute.<br/>
<br/>
 I just need to know you're alright.<br/>
<br/>
 [Pounding on door]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door opens]<br/>
<br/>
 I'm alright, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Good.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, I'm glad you're alright.<br/>
<br/>
 I Uh can I come in?<br/>
<br/>
 Just talk for a minute?<br/>
<br/>
 ["It Never Entered My Mind" playing]<br/>
<br/>
 [Refrigerator humming softly]<br/>
<br/>
 As you can see, I'm more than alright.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm very well, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
 How?<br/>
<br/>
 I always told you I'd get better.<br/>
<br/>
 You just never believed me.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure I did.<br/>
<br/>
 But, Chuck [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 this is great!<br/>
<br/>
 How did you do it?<br/>
<br/>
 What was it you wanted?<br/>
<br/>
 Beyond "proof of life"?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 S-Something happened, and it made me think about what ha went down between you and me.<br/>
<br/>
 And[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I wanted to say, in hindsight, I could've made different choices.<br/>
<br/>
 - Is that so?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, I'm not saying it's all on me.<br/>
<br/>
 It's not.<br/>
<br/>
 But if I had to do it all over again [Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
 I would maybe do some things differently.<br/>
<br/>
 And I just thought you should know that.<br/>
<br/>
 That you have regrets?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I have regrets.<br/>
<br/>
 - Mm.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Why?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 'Cause you're my brother.<br/>
<br/>
 There aren't that many of us McGills left, and, uh, I think we should stick together.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Why have regrets at all?<br/>
<br/>
 What's the point?<br/>
<br/>
 What do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, look at you.<br/>
<br/>
 You're in so much pain.<br/>
<br/>
 Why are you putting yourself through all this?<br/>
<br/>
 'Cause I wanted to tell you That you have regrets.<br/>
<br/>
 And I'm telling you: don't bother.<br/>
<br/>
 What's the point?<br/>
<br/>
 You're just gonna keep hurting people.<br/>
<br/>
 - That's not true.<br/>
<br/>
 - Jimmy, this is what you do.<br/>
<br/>
 You hurt people.<br/>
<br/>
 Over and over and over.<br/>
<br/>
 And then there's this show of remorse It's not a "show"!<br/>
<br/>
 I know you don't think it's a show.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't doubt your emotions are real, but what's the point of all the sad faces and the gnashing of teeth?<br/>
<br/>
 If you're not going to change your behavior [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 and you won't - I can change.<br/>
<br/>
 - why not just skip the whole exercise?<br/>
<br/>
 In the end, you're going to hurt everyone around you.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't help it.<br/>
<br/>
 So, stop apologizing and accept it.<br/>
<br/>
 Embrace it.<br/>
<br/>
 Frankly, I'd have more respect for you if you did.<br/>
<br/>
 - What about you, Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
 - Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
 You didn't do anything wrong?<br/>
<br/>
 You're just an innocent victim?<br/>
<br/>
 Let me put your mind at ease, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 You don't have to make up with me.<br/>
<br/>
 We don't have to understand each other.<br/>
<br/>
 Things are fine the way they are.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 I don't want to hurt your feelings but the truth is you've never mattered all that much to me.<br/>

<br/>
 What a nice surprise.<br/>
<br/>
 Irene!<br/>
<br/>
 As beautiful as ever!<br/>
<br/>
 Why don't you come in?<br/>
<br/>
 - Can I get you some tea?<br/>
<br/>
 - [Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I don't want to be a bother.<br/>
<br/>
 I just have a couple things to drop off.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, w-what is all this?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, when we win, we celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
 That's very sweet.<br/>
<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 And I didn't forget about Oscar and Felix.<br/>
<br/>
 I've got some kitty toys and catnip in there for those two little rascals.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 You shouldn't have, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Of course I should.<br/>
<br/>
 [Claps hands]<br/>
<br/>
 Now, have you given any thought to how you want to spend that settlement money?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know Well, I'll tell you what I'd do.<br/>
<br/>
 Alaskan cruise.<br/>
<br/>
 You can walk on a glacier under the Aurora Borealis.<br/>
<br/>
 And if Alaska's too cold, maybe a European river cruise.<br/>
<br/>
 Float on down the Danube.<br/>
<br/>
 I bet you and the ladies could split a deluxe suite.<br/>
<br/>
 Get into all sorts of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
 That sounds very nice, but I don't think they'd really want to.<br/>
<br/>
 Why not?<br/>
<br/>
 They're still upset.<br/>
<br/>
 They must be excited about the settlement though, right?<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: But you can't let one little misunderstanding - destroy years of friendship.<br/>
<br/>
 - ["Steal Away" plays in background]<br/>
<br/>
 Myrtle: Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 She showed her true colors.<br/>
<br/>
 When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<br/>
<br/>
 It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.<br/>
<br/>
 She came around.<br/>
<br/>
 She just wanted to get back on our good side Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 How do you trust someone who bends any way the wind is blowing?<br/>
<br/>
 Where is her integrity?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I can't help but blame myself.<br/>
<br/>
 You were just trying to help.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong, and I stirred the pot.<br/>
<br/>
 So [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
 Look, if you want to blame someone, you should blame me.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, you're a good friend.<br/>
<br/>
 She doesn't deserve you.<br/>
<br/>
 - No, she doesn't.<br/>
<br/>

 Yes, I have checked.<br/>

 Several times.<br/>
<br/>
 The power meter is still turning.<br/>
<br/>
 All I can think is that there's something in the house that isn't wired through the breaker box and it's drawing power.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, I-I want you to send someone over to find it and disconnect it.<br/>

 I Wednesday?<br/>

 Don Hector.<br/>

 Don Eladio wanted me to speak with you face to face, so there's no misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
 From now on, there will be only one route over the border for our product the chicken trucks.<br/>
<br/>
 That is final.<br/>
<br/>
 But you must understand this is for efficiency only there's no disrespect to you or your family.<br/>
<br/>
 What's he doing here?<br/>
<br/>
 The boss wants you to settle this.<br/>
<br/>
 I settle it right now, okay?<br/>

 You have to work together.<br/>

 It's what the boss wants.<br/>
<br/>
 The boss can suck me.<br/>

 I'd watch what I say if I were you.<br/>

 Who you think you are?<br/>

 You should be kissing my ass right now.<br/>

 Join me.<br/>

 Oh dip dip it in the sauce.<br/>

<br/>

 Mmm.<br/>
<br/>
 So what's next?<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Monty Python.<br/>
<br/>
 Solid choice.<br/>
<br/>
 Or we could just watch "To k*ll a Mockingbird" again.<br/>
<br/>
 - Again?<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah, I watched it this morning.<br/>
<br/>
 It was my favorite when I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
 I loved Atticus Finch.<br/>
<br/>
 All the girls were in love with Gregory Peck.<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 I wasn't in love with him.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, a little.<br/>
<br/>
 But, no.<br/>
<br/>
 I wanted to be him.<br/>
<br/>
 Fight the good fight.<br/>
<br/>
 Change the world.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Didn't you?<br/>
<br/>
 That was more Chuck's thing.<br/>
<br/>
 But, I mean, the good news is you made it!<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I am.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm changing the world by helping a mid-size local bank become a mid-size regional bank.<br/>
<br/>
 Yay me.<br/>
<br/>
 So no luck with Ms.<br/>
<br/>
 Landry?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>

 sh**t.<br/>

 Ashes.<br/>

<br/>
 - [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 T-There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
 And I've tried everything.<br/>
<br/>
 I sent muffin baskets to the gals.<br/>
<br/>
 - I signed them from her.<br/>
<br/>
 - Nice.<br/>
<br/>
 They saw right through it.<br/>
<br/>
 "Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, she doesn't deserve you.<br/>
<br/>
 " The more I try to make them like her again, the more they end up lovin' me instead.<br/>
<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
<br/>
 Well sounds like you've exhausted all your options I mean, if muffin baskets don't solve it I don't know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not good at building shit, you know?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm excellent at tearing it down.<br/>
<br/>

 - See?<br/>

 - [Crunching]<br/>

 You know, sometimes, you got to play to your strengths.<br/>

 You should stitch that on a pillow.<br/>

 Oh, I will.<br/>

 All right.<br/>
<br/>
 Screw it.<br/>

 What is it?<br/>

 [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
 Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Landry.<br/>
<br/>
 You figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>

 But I really, really don't wanna do it.<br/>

 - Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
 - All: Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
 I know that many of you were expecting Sandy for this morning's chair yoga, but her daughter has a cold.<br/>
<br/>
 - [All groan]<br/>
<br/>
 - But she'll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, the nice folks in front said I could sit in.<br/>
<br/>
 So, you guys ready to get to it?<br/>
<br/>
 All: Yes.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling]<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Let's wake up those spines with, uh, cat/cow position.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
 Very good.<br/>
<br/>
 Cat [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 And then cow [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 Sit up straight.<br/>
<br/>
 Very good, Jasper.<br/>
<br/>
 Cat [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 And cow [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 Long, deep breaths.<br/>
<br/>
 Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.<br/>
<br/>
 [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 And cow [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 And cat [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 - Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 Erin Brill!<br/>
<br/>
 You're just in time for chair yoga.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 - I need to talk to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, well, pull up a chair.<br/>
<br/>
 There's always room for one more.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Exhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 - Now, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
 - What?<br/>
<br/>
 - You are unbelievable.<br/>
<br/>
 I could not, for the life of me, figure out why on earth Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Landry would suddenly change her mind about the Sandpiper settlement.<br/>
<br/>
 I had to practically drag the information out of her that you filled her head and all of her friends' heads with lies.<br/>
<br/>
 I never lied to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
 You drastically misrepresented the reality of the case.<br/>
<br/>
 So?<br/>
<br/>
 So?!<br/>
<br/>
 You took advantage of poor Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Landry.<br/>
<br/>
 Does she know how much money you're gonna make from this?<br/>
<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
<br/>
 And again I ask so what?<br/>
<br/>
 These people trusted you, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have any idea how much time I had to put in listening to their insipid ramblings about their sciatica or which grandchild disappoints them the most?<br/>
<br/>
 Damn right they trust me.<br/>
<br/>
 I worked my ass off earning their trust.<br/>
<br/>
 Then you betrayed it.<br/>
<br/>
 If the only thing standing between me and a million bucks is some old lady's tears, then I'd suggest investing in Kleenex.<br/>
<br/>
 You've ruined her life because you wanted your money faster.<br/>
<br/>
 Boo and hoo.<br/>
<br/>
 Besides, it's not like she's got that much time left, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 You're disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
 And rich.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
 Apologies!<br/>
<br/>
 That was probably more like 20 breaths instead of 10.<br/>
<br/>
 - [All murmuring]<br/>
<br/>
 - Uh.<br/>

<br/>
 Shame on you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicles passing in distance]<br/>
<br/>
 So?<br/>
<br/>
 Like a charm, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 She'll go back on the settlement?<br/>
<br/>
 I imagine you'll hear from her within an hour or so.<br/>
<br/>
 - Good.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 Well done in there.<br/>
<br/>
 I meant every word I said.<br/>
<br/>
 I know.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Footsteps depart]<br/>
<br/>
 [Car door opens, closes]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 - Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I'll meet you guys there in about an hour.<br/>
<br/>
 - We'll unload.<br/>
<br/>
 - Sounds good.<br/>
<br/>
 [Truck door closes]<br/>
<br/>
 [Latch clinks]<br/>
<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
<br/>
 You guys about done?<br/>
<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, I, um I'm real sorry that this didn't work out.<br/>
<br/>
 It's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 I already talked to my old supervisor at the MVD.<br/>
<br/>
 Looks like they can take me back.<br/>
<br/>
 - So - Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 That's great.<br/>
<br/>
 And, you know, if we ever get another office up, you'd be our first call.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Good to know.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye, Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye.<br/>
<br/>
 She understands.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
 So, uh, what's left?<br/>
<br/>
 I think this is it.<br/>
<br/>
 This is all admin stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, appointment book.<br/>
<br/>
 Your Rolodex.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Thuds]<br/>
<br/>
 - Hey, why'd you do that?<br/>
<br/>
 Because no senior's coming within 20 feet of me ever again.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm gonna need a whole new business model when I get my license back.<br/>
<br/>
 Kim.<br/>
<br/>
 It's pointless.<br/>
<br/>
 They're smearing my name across the tri-state area.<br/>
<br/>
 Sendin' telegrams to everyone far and near.<br/>
<br/>
 You never know.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
 It's a good wall.<br/>
<br/>
 You think?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll get another.<br/>
<br/>
 A better wall.<br/>
