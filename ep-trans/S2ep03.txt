You faked evidence.<br/>
<br/>
Mmm, I think you're splitting hairs.<br/>
<br/>
Why would you risk the best job you've ever had for some pro-bono case?<br/>

I was hoping, maybe, you could do me a favor.<br/>

Anything you need, I'll be there.<br/>

You still in touch with your people?<br/>

Depends on the type of work you're looking for.<br/>

You tell me what you got.<br/>

Could someone tell me if Mrs. Alma May Urbano is on board?<br/>
<br/>
Alma May Urbano.<br/>
<br/>
There you are. Hello, dear.<br/>
<br/>
Very good to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
My name's Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to visit you at Sandpiper, but they wouldn't allow me to.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you know what?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter.<br/>
<br/>
I saw your bus broken down, here you are.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky me.<br/>
<br/>
Do you prefer to be called Mrs. Urbano or Alma May or just plain Alma?<br/>
<br/>
My last name is McGill, but you can call me Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, everyone! My name's Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an attorney at law, but, uh, don't mind me.<br/>
<br/>
Just talk amongst yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Alma May, do you recall responding to a mailer from my law firm, Davis &amp; Main, of Santa Fe, New Mexico?<br/>
<br/>
I... I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we were looking to help any Sandpiper residents who may have been overcharged for, uh, basic goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
Now, does that ring a bell?<br/>
<br/>
Oh! Maybe. Was it yellow?<br/>
<br/>
It's canary yellow.<br/>
<br/>
I picked that color myself.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Well, ma'am, I'm here to make sure you get your money back.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Man</strong>: What are you talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Who took Alma May's money?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, well, now, that's a very good question.<br/>
<br/>
And thank you for asking, mister, uh...?<br/>
<br/>
Amos... Amos Lydecker.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Now, nobody took anybody's money, uh, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Okay?<br/>
<br/>
It's not like the Sandpiper people, you know, put on a ski mask and, uh... mugged Alma May here at gunpoint.<br/>
<br/>
So I want you to put that mental image right out of your head.<br/>
<br/>
See, what we're talking about here is more of a... it's just a discrepancy.<br/>
<br/>
It's... it's a little thing.<br/>
<br/>
It's... it's fairly innocent.<br/>
<br/>
But we need to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you follow me?<br/>
<br/>
Well, put it this way.<br/>
<br/>
Alma May, let's say you're out on a date with your boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
You do have a boyfriend, right?<br/>
<br/>
[Laughter]<br/>
<br/>
Ah! You don't?<br/>
<br/>
Come on. You...<br/>
<br/>
Alma May's holding out on me.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a nephew?<br/>
<br/>
Nephew? Oh, y-yes... Steve.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Steve.<br/>
<br/>
Is he a good guy?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, very good.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
So, let's say you and Steve go out to dinner at, uh... well, Birdie's.<br/>
<br/>
That's where you're all headed today, right?<br/>
<br/>
[All murmuring] All right.<br/>
<br/>
So, both of you have a great meal.<br/>
<br/>
It's chicken-fried steak and green beans, and it's all perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the check.<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, wait a doggone..."<br/>
<br/>
24 bucks for a side of buttermilk biscuits?<br/>
<br/>
"That doesn't sound right, now, does it?"<br/>
<br/>
[All murmuring]<br/>
<br/>
No, it does not.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like something got added up wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Well, naturally, you send your nephew Steve to talk to the manager, and naturally, the manager corrects the mistake.<br/>
<br/>
And what's more, he gives you a coupon for a free meal next time you come in.<br/>
<br/>
How about that?<br/>
<br/>
[All murmuring] Good.<br/>
<br/>
Well, same kind of thing is what happened at Sandpiper Crossing.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
And nothing makes me sadder than to see people of the Greatest Generation... people like my own Nana and Bobo... gettin' overcharged by some great, big company... even if it was an accident.<br/>
<br/>
[All murmur]<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know that the good people at Sandpiper want to make this right sooner or later, but you know what?<br/>
<br/>
Well, sometimes, it's just easier if you get your nephew Steve to go take care of it for you.<br/>
<br/>
And that's how I want you to think of me.<br/>

Hey, there, Georgie girl. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's all there, everything I need.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much. Enjoy your lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Alma May, you did it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much. Thank you.<br/>

Schweikart and Cokely are pursuing an aggressive strategy, but looking at the relevant case law, I don't think it's going to play with this magistrate judge.<br/>
<br/>
I read over a dozen of her rulings, all of which have sided with the plaintiff on cases like this.<br/>
<br/>
I've included a memo to that effect in today's materials, which you can peruse at your leisure.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Cliff</strong>: Thanks, Erin.<br/>
<br/>
How about we move on to client outreach?<br/>
<br/>
[Man clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Howard</strong>: Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
You still with us?<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat] Uh...<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna save you from having to brag.<br/>
<br/>
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients signed over the past three weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Well-done, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Thanks, Cliff.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, right now, we're in the process of mapping out the entire southwest, targeting the largest Sandpiper facilities first.<br/>
<br/>
Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Fort Worth, Provo... that's just for starters.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, my goal... another 200 by the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
With this many folks, we have an excellent shot at a solid batch of plaintiffs for the classes in each district.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Cliff</strong>: Excellent.<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to the next report.<br/>
<br/>
On to a stickier wicket... coordinating actions.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Before we move on, I'd like to go back to client outreach just for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Looking over these numbers here, really, astonishing results, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Incredible.<br/>
<br/>
Your last trip to Amarillo, you came back with 22 new clients.<br/>
<br/>
24.<br/>
<br/>
24. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I'm confused.<br/>
<br/>
Um, how many people out there actually responded to our direct mailer?<br/>
<br/>
One.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Right. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
A Mrs. Alma May Urbano.<br/>
<br/>
But you got 24 new clients from this one response?<br/>
<br/>
That is... [Chuckles] Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you're welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what? Is there a problem?<br/>
<br/>
Well, uh, might not some parties... the opposing counsel, for example... see this differential and conclude that there may have been some solicitation involved?<br/>
<br/>
I did not solicit.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just wondering how you account for your success.<br/>
<br/>
Because it will definitely raise eyebrows over at Schweikart &amp; Cokely.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, but it will.<br/>
<br/>
Particularly in a case involving seniors, for whom the ethical guidelines on solicitation were virtually created by the ABA.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, I'm sure that...<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, if you could clear this up, that would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Amarillo to confer with a client and to make sure that we had a solid, good-faith basis for our case there, overall.<br/>
<br/>
And as many of you are aware, I've visited more than my share of retirement homes.<br/>
<br/>
These are close-knit communities.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, word gets around real fast.<br/>
<br/>
If Dorothy in Phase Two gets a new Rascal Scooter, well, it's big news.<br/>
<br/>
So these other 23 residents, they approached you.<br/>
<br/>
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt before I crossed state lines.<br/>
<br/>
And I certainly didn't have to go knocking on any doors.<br/>
<br/>
And is it any surprise that they want to speak with the guy who was there to show them they may have money coming their way?<br/>
<br/>
I gotta tell you, with all that in mind, I should've done better.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Makes sense. Howard?<br/>
<br/>
Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
We good to move on?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Cliff</strong>: And, Chuck, not incidentally, it is absolutely vital that we dot our I's and cross our T's here.<br/>
<br/>
Invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
So, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
The price of excellence is eternal vigilance.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Howard</strong>: Coordination.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that's where we left off.<br/>
<br/>
That's right.<br/>
<br/>
Brian, this is your thing, so why don't you take this?<br/>
<br/>
Sure. [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Brian</strong>: Considering the dimensions of these cases, taken together and individually, it makes sense to designate someone to handle the scheduling.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm proposing is that we create a small team at D&amp;M dedicated specifically to coordinating all elements of the individual actions.<br/>
<br/>
We'll loop in HHM on anything...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Brian, I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me for interrupting.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I just want to say that I take Chuck's point.<br/>
<br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, this is, like, a wife-of-Caesar type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
There can't even be a hint of solicitation.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm gonna pull back.<br/>
<br/>
All right, no more meet-and-greets at the Sandpiper facilities.<br/>
<br/>
I'll find another way to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Cliff</strong>: Well, Jimmy, we'll leave that up to you.<br/>
<br/>
You know, client outreach is your department.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, where was I?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, right.<br/>
<br/>
If we have a more consolidated nerve center here in New Mexico, where the...<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Kim, uh, where can I get a copy of that Neiderman deposition?<br/>
<br/>
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
You can have one of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wow. Thanks, Erin.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, no worries.<br/>
<br/>
sh**t. Where'd I put that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, that's...<br/>
<br/>
Man, do you believe Chuck in there?<br/>
<br/>
Jesus. Solicitation?<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, when we were building this case, I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">That</em> was solicitation.<br/>
<br/>
But did he say "boo"?<br/>
<br/>
Bullshit he did.<br/>
<br/>
What happened in Texas?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I did my job.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't do a song and dance in the dayroom for the old-timers?<br/>
<br/>
No. No.<br/>
<br/>
Not... not in the dayroom.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, you know solicitation can get you disbarred.<br/>
<br/>
This matters.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here's what I think matters...<br/>
<br/>
24 senior citizens now have representation.<br/>
<br/>
Before I went, they didn't even know they were getting ripped off.<br/>
<br/>
Now they have us in their corner.<br/>
<br/>
How is that not a win?<br/>
<br/>
You said in there you'd find another way.<br/>
<br/>
Did you mean it?<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Absolutely. I...<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Look, I...<br/>
<br/>
I need you to understand something very critical here.<br/>
<br/>
sh**t.<br/>
<br/>
I put myself on the line to get you this job.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, okay.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it was 'cause I'm sensational with old people.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and who do you think told them that?<br/>
<br/>
So, what... you threw me a bone?<br/>
<br/>
No... assh*le.<br/>
<br/>
You know I believe in you.<br/>
<br/>
But then I made my beliefs known to them.<br/>
<br/>
And now everything you do reflects back on me with Howard, 'cause ultimately, I talked him into going out on a limb for you, too.<br/>
<br/>
Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
It's... it's... it's my word, it's my judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You and I both know you can do this job.<br/>
<br/>
But please, you just have to do it right.<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversation in distance]<br/>

But you shouldn't feel that you need to...<br/>

Too late.<br/>

[Kaylee talking indistinctly]<br/>
<br/>
Something up?<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No, it's...<br/>

You tell me it's none of my business, I'll drop it.<br/>

I don't want you to worry.<br/>
<br/>
Not the worrying kind.<br/>

[Kaylee talking indistinctly]<br/>
<br/>
Last two nights, I heard g*nshots.<br/>
<br/>
First night, they were maybe a block or two over and woke me up.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was firecrackers, and that's what I assumed at the time, but then last night... there's no mistaking it.<br/>
<br/>
There was three of them.<br/>
<br/>
They were quick... pop, pop, pop... closer.<br/>
<br/>
It was...<br/>
<br/>
[Whispering] Like they were right outside the house.<br/>
<br/>
You call the cops?<br/>
<br/>
[Normal voice] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Took them over an hour to get here, then they looked around for a whole two minutes, but by then, of course, there was nothing to see.<br/>
<br/>
[Kaylee laughs]<br/>
<br/>
I'm staying here tonight.<br/>
<br/>
No, Mike, no.<br/>
<br/>
That's not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
No, it is not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I'll take the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Mike, you asked, so... I answered.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't make me sorry I told you.<br/>

<br/>
What about Colorado Springs?<br/>
<br/>
Um...<br/>
<br/>
283 residents, and we sent out 283 mailers.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and how many response cards came back?<br/>
<br/>
Zero.<br/>
<br/>
Zero?<br/>

<br/>
Dana, Toni, have a good one.<br/>
<br/>
You, too, Mr. Main.<br/>
<br/>
Cliff, uh, could I have a second?<br/>
<br/>
What's up?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah, it's the Sandpiper mailers.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we should be getting responses of like 12 to 15 percent, but we're getting ones and twos.<br/>
<br/>
In Colorado Springs, zero.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. How can that be?<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking it's the staff.<br/>
<br/>
They're tossing the mailers before they can reach the residents.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they got told to do it by the Sandpiper front office, which would be actionable as hell.<br/>
<br/>
If we could prove it. Big "if."<br/>
<br/>
And to do so would take more manpower than I can spare.<br/>
<br/>
For now, let's just stick with getting those client numbers up.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
10:00 a.m., water aerobics.<br/>
<br/>
2:00 p.m., line dancing.<br/>
<br/>
So on and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
They always leave 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. free.<br/>
<br/>
Why? "m*rder, She Wrote."<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
It's been in syndication since like the 1850s, and let me tell you, when that thing comes on, it draws the blue-hairs like moths to a bug zapper.<br/>

<br/>
3:14 p.m., end of the first-act cliffhanger, first commercial up, Davis &amp; Main.<br/>
<br/>
Guaranteed eyeballs... lots of 'em.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing Sandpiper can do about that.<br/>
<br/>
We ran a commercial a few years back... another class-action case.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of a new thing for us.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it's not exactly my go-to, but generally speaking, I'm open to it.<br/>

We will talk next week.<br/>
