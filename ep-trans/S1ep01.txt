This is our first renoir of the evening.<br/>

This is a heliogravure, which is an etching.<br/>

It was hand-pulled from a copper plate in Paris in 1919.<br/>

We know this because that's what it says on the back, where the certificate of authenticity is located.<br/>

Just as lovely as can be.<br/>

Look at the soft, delicate shading. Very feminine.<br/>

Big swath of light to moderate snow from the broken bow area down toward Kearney, Hastings, Grand Island... That is all moving in our direction.<br/>
<br/>
So I do think, around 7:00 to 8:00, the snow will become pretty steady here across the region with all this moving on top of us, and that's really gonna knock down visibilities.<br/>

<em class="text-italics">When it comes to compaction...<br/>
<br/>
There's really two different types of compaction.<br/>
<br/>
There's vertical compaction, and there's horizontal compaction.<br/>

And there's a big difference.</em><br/>
<br/>
[Clattering]<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">With horizontal compaction, there really isn't much hope for help from a freeze thaw.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason why, as that hard, compacted layer swells And then, in the spring, thaws back out and settles back down.<br/>
<br/>
There's really no breaking up of the compaction.<br/>
<br/>
With a vertical zone, when compaction swells out, and then it breaks up in the spring, then you can actually get a little bit of help.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have some horizontal compaction...</em><br/>

I... It's just not all there yet.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, if we were all held responsible [claps hands] For what we did when we were 19...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

Oh, to be 19 again... You with me, ladies and gentlemen?<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember 19?<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you... The juices are flowing.<br/>
<br/>
The red corpuscles are corpuscling, the grass is green, and it's soft, and summer's gonna last forever.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles, inhales sharply] Now, do you remember?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you do. [Clears throat]<br/>
<br/>
But if you're being honest... I mean, well, really honest, you'll recall that you also had an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.<br/>
<br/>
Me, personally, I... It... If I were held accountable for some of the stupid decisions I made when I was 19... [chuckling] Oh, boy, wow.<br/>
<br/>
And I bet if we were in church right now, I'd get a big "amen!"<br/>
<br/>
Which brings us to these three...<br/>
<br/>
Now, these three knuckleheads...<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sorry, boys, but that's what you are...<br/>
<br/>
They did a dumb thing. We're not denying that.<br/>
<br/>
However, I would like you to remember two salient facts.<br/>
<br/>
Fact one... Nobody got hurt, not a soul.<br/>
<br/>
Very important to keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Fact two... Now, the prosecution keeps bandying this term "criminal trespass."<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Spinowzo, the property owner, admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business open to the public both day and night.<br/>
<br/>
So, trespassing? [Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
That's a bit of a reach... Don't you think, Dave?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles, inhales sharply] Here's what I know...<br/>
<br/>
These three young men, near honors students all, were feeling their oats one Saturday night, and they just... Went a little bananas.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Call me crazy, but I don't think they deserve to have their bright futures ruined by a momentary, minute, never-to-be-repeated lapse of judgment.<br/>

Don't do anything, guys. Just relax, all right?<br/>

Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why you think he needs a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, Craig, the way you run your office is beyond reproach.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah. Beyond reproach.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I'm a stickler, you know, for...<br/>
<br/>
He is. He's a stickler with the money.<br/>
<br/>
He's definitely a stickler.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, he's certainly not guilty of some...<br/>
<br/>
Is certainly not. He's innocent of any wrongdoing.<br/>
<br/>
That's abundantly clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
And frankly, I don't go looking for guilty people to represent.<br/>
<br/>
I mean [chuckling] who needs that aggravation, right?<br/>
<br/>
Right. [Laughter]<br/>
<br/>
Look, all I know is what I read in the paper.<br/>
<br/>
And typically, when money goes missing from the county treasury... And the number here is, uh, $1.6 million...<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's an accounting...<br/>
<br/>
It's an accounting discrepancy.<br/>
<br/>
It's a discrepancy, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
But typically, when that happens, the police look at the treasurer.<br/>
<br/>
And since that person is, uh... [chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
I just think a little proactivity may be in order.<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
You know, I just think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones, and innocent people get arrested every day.<br/>
<br/>
And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend.<br/>
<br/>
"Talk to me," he says. Uh, "help me clear this thing up.<br/>
<br/>
You don't need a lawyer... Only guilty people need lawyers."<br/>
<br/>
And boom!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, that's when it all goes south.<br/>

That's when you want someone in your corner, someone who will fight tooth and nail.<br/>

Ow! What the hell, man?!<br/>

Listen, starlight express, I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique, 0.0 for choice of victim.<br/>

I'm a lawyer. [Laughs]<br/>

Furthermore, does... Does this steaming pile of crap scream "payday" to you, huh?!<br/>

The only way that entire car is worth 500 bucks is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.<br/>

You work for people who have sex with chopped-off head?<br/>

It's okay, Brenda, we got it.<br/>

Hey, Jack. Hey, Nate. Hey, Aaron.<br/>
<br/>
What can we do for you, Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. It's... It's this table.<br/>
<br/>
Something just comes over me.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell me what this, uh, $26,000 is supposed to be for.<br/>
<br/>
That's money for Chuck. Isn't that what you wanted?<br/>
<br/>
A measly 26 grand? [Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians.<br/>
<br/>
Throw in some beads and shells while you're at it.<br/>
<br/>
It's just a start. There'll be more...<br/>
<br/>
Unless you're gonna just tear them all up.<br/>
<br/>
And why was it made out to me... Why not Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
Can he make his way to the bank?<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales sharply]<br/>
<br/>
I just assumed it was best to have the money go through you.<br/>
<br/>
We can do it any way you want.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't going away, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
What Chuck did for this firm... And damn near single-handedly...<br/>
<br/>
1/3 of this place belongs to him.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. What do you got... 12 chairs here?<br/>
<br/>
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.<br/>
<br/>
You got five of these light thingumajigs?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, mm, 1 2/3 are Chuck's.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Six... How many danishes... Six danishes?<br/>
<br/>
You can have all the Danish you want, Jimmy. No, no.<br/>
<br/>
They're Chuck's danishes, and Chuck isn't greedy, so h-he'll just take two...<br/>
<br/>
Plus $17 million... In that ballpark.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, we'll know once we get the accountants poking around here.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, no more penny-ante checks designed to make it look like Chuck still works here.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't. He never will again.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to do right by him and cash him out.<br/>
<br/>
So, these are Chuck's own wishes that you're conveying?<br/>
<br/>
This is what's best for him.<br/>
<br/>
Mm.<br/>
<br/>
So he personally told you that it's his wish to withdraw from the firm?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
See, that would surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
It's been nearly a year since he's set foot in here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just doing what's in his best interests.<br/>
<br/>
So am I.<br/>
<br/>
And I, for one, believe he's gonna lick this thing.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, his office is just as he left it.<br/>
<br/>
His secretary's still on payroll.<br/>
<br/>
If Chuck can call this an extended sabbatical, then so can we... He's that important to us.<br/>
<br/>
You know what? Let's let a jury figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Yeah, they're gonna love you, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
You're so down-to-earth and relatable.<br/>
<br/>
And you... Will... Atone!<br/>

No, stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.<br/>

Can we talk?<br/>

<br/>
You look peaked.<br/>
<br/>
I'm fine. Please, just sit.<br/>

You're not in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Um... You got to cash out.<br/>
<br/>
You got to.<br/>
<br/>
Again? Really? There's no other way.<br/>

I know that you don't want to hear it, but you've got to.<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm going to beat this.<br/>
<br/>
You know I'm going to get better.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, sure.<br/>

[Chuckling] Well, then, there's nothing more to talk about.<br/>

I will beat this.<br/>

You proceed from false principles.<br/>
<br/>
Your argument is built on quicksand.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, it collapses.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah. You're not listening.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Fine.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take this to its logical conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
In order to pay out my share, suppose my partners are forced to liquidate the firm.<br/>
<br/>
Then what?<br/>
<br/>
That's their problem.<br/>
<br/>
My clients are out in the cold.<br/>
<br/>
My cases are scattered to the winds.<br/>
<br/>
126 people lose their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
What happens to your cronies in the mailroom, the assistants, the paralegals, the janitorial staff?<br/>
<br/>
All of them, out on the street.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend Kim... a promising career... over and done with.<br/>
<br/>
Hamlin owes you everything.<br/>
<br/>
You built that place single-handedly while he was out at four hills working on his bunker shot.<br/>
<br/>
Let's not exaggerate. I helped. You helped.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
All the more reason not to tear it down just for a little bit of cash.<br/>
<br/>
Look... Chuck, I'm going under, okay?<br/>
<br/>
For the third time with these bull-crap contract counsel...<br/>
<br/>
"Bull crap"?<br/>
<br/>
Bull-crap, pissant P.D.<br/>
<br/>
Cases at 700 bucks a shot.<br/>
<br/>
Public-defender work is some of the best experience there is.<br/>
<br/>
I just had a case, Chuck, with three clients...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial...<br/>
<br/>
The whole nine yards.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I took home? 700 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I might as well head down to skid row and sell plasma.<br/>
<br/>
You're representing people who have nowhere else to turn.<br/>
<br/>
The money is beside the point.<br/>
<br/>
Money is not<em class="text-italics"> beside</em> the point... Money <em class="text-italics">is</em> the point.<br/>
<br/>
I keep telling you... Have patience.<br/>
<br/>
There are no shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Do good work, and the clients will come.<br/>
<br/>
The clients will come. Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Hand to God, I wasn't gonna say this, but you are broke.<br/>
<br/>
I can't carry both of us.<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Well, you're saying what?<br/>
<br/>
You think you have to provide for me?<br/>
<br/>
I never asked you that. You didn't have to ask, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I've been doing my damnedest, but the day of reckoning is here.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be out on the street with all the electromagnetism in the world raining down on you.<br/>
<br/>
Now, please, please, picture that, then tell me that money is beside the point.<br/>
<br/>
This is what has you all worked up?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy... There's nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Here.<br/>
<br/>
What is this?<br/>
<br/>
A stipend... There's gonna be one every week.<br/>
<br/>
$857 from Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna pay them back... Every penny.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to take anything, but Howard was very insistent.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm gonna pay <em class="text-italics">you</em> back, too.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, Hamlin was here?<br/>
<br/>
It's not like I'm a recluse.<br/>
<br/>
What? He put his cellphone in the mailbox?<br/>
<br/>
He understands the situation.<br/>
<br/>
He grounded himself?<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
<br/>
And the two of you agreed that since, as everybody knows, you're going back to work any day now, that the firm should help you make ends meet.<br/>
<br/>
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
Hamlin's making you a chump!<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to get better!<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna go back to work, and I'm picking up where I left off!<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles, sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
[Inhales deeply]<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you're trying to look out for me, but you're missing the bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
I got it.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] Speaking of which...<br/>
<br/>
Howard brought this.<br/>
<br/>
He's concerned.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
You have to admit... It could be confusing...<br/>
<br/>
Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?<br/>
<br/>
James M. Mcgill?<br/>
<br/>
That's my name.<br/>
<br/>
I was born with it. I...<br/>
<br/>
Still...<br/>
<br/>
How about Vanguard law?<br/>
<br/>
Or gi... Gibraltar legal... Wait, wait.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm not supposed to use my name o... On Hamlin's say-so?<br/>
<br/>
What's he gonna do... Sue me?<br/>
<br/>
Nobody wants to create an adversarial situation.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost of new matchbooks and so on.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
It's simply a matter of professional courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
[Ticking continues]<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, whose side are you on?<br/>
<br/>
There are no sides.<br/>
<br/>
But, Jimmy... [sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you rather build your own identity?<br/>
<br/>
Why ride on someone else's coattails?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighing]<br/>
<br/>
[Insects chirping]<br/>
<br/>
You want to dance, Howard?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Let's dance.<br/>
<br/>
Go!<br/>
<br/>
No, you can get closer than that, you b*tch.<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>
<br/>
And here it comes.<br/>
<br/>
There you go. Better.<br/>
<br/>
[Cheering in distance]<br/>
<br/>
How was that?<br/>
<br/>
It's right on here. Take a look.<br/>
<br/>
Still, tighter is everything.<br/>
<br/>
Tighter? What? T... Tighter what?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Just stand... Tighter.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I mean? I don't know what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
That sucked. We can call that a stylistic choice, I guess, if you want to...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, fellas.<br/>
<br/>
We got business.<br/>
<br/>
How did you find us?<br/>
<br/>
I know... Eerie, right.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Give me 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Could be the most profitable 30 seconds of your lives.<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you about a young guy...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he's about your age.<br/>
<br/>
He lived a long way from here in a town called Cicero, Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
And in Cicero, he was the man.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, when he strolled down the street, all the corner boys would give him the high five.<br/>
<br/>
All the finest babes would smile at him and hope that he would smile back.<br/>
<br/>
They called him "slippin' Jimmy," and everybody wanted to be his friend.<br/>
<br/>
"Slippin' Jimmy"?<br/>
<br/>
What the hell kind of name is [chuckling] that?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'll tell you, now...<br/>
<br/>
Winters in Cicero are m*rder. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
You guys growing up out here in the golden west...<br/>
<br/>
Y... You don't know, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter, but not Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy waited around all summer, and when September finally rolled around and he'd feel that first cold wind come sweeping off lake Michigan, he knew<em class="text-italics"> it</em> was coming.<br/>
<br/>
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?<br/>
<br/>
Better... It was slip 'n fall season.<br/>
<br/>
Soon as it was cold enough, he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.<br/>
<br/>
State street was good. Michigan Avenue was better.<br/>
<br/>
He'd pick his spot, wait for it to get busy, then he'd walk out on the ice, and... Boom!<br/>
<br/>
He would biff it so hard, people would come running from five blocks away.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but did he collect?<br/>
<br/>
"Did he collect?"<br/>
<br/>
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialed in, all right?<br/>
<br/>
One good fall... He'd clear 6, 8 grand.<br/>
<br/>
That'd keep him in old Milwaukee and Maui Wowie right through labor day.<br/>
<br/>
8 grand?<br/>
<br/>
8 grand.<br/>
<br/>
Now, see, I look at you guys, I see potential.<br/>
<br/>
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle...<br/>
<br/>
That makes it a year-round gig.<br/>
<br/>
And clearly, you know how to take a header, right?<br/>
<br/>
But I got to ask you... Your best day ever, how much did you clear?<br/>
<br/>
$630. $630.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] 630 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
Was that for one fall?<br/>
<br/>
Two. Two falls in one day. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Even at your age, that's got to hurt.<br/>
<br/>
True that.<br/>
<br/>
All right, well, I got a job for you.<br/>
<br/>
How's 2 grand sound?<br/>
<br/>
2 grand for one hit?<br/>
<br/>
One hit.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, you get to learn from the best.<br/>
<br/>
Nice boat.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, discreet, like a stripper pole in a mosque.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, forget the boat. Look at the car.<br/>
<br/>
You know what that is?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. A station wagon?<br/>
<br/>
It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury sable wagon.<br/>
<br/>
Remember it. Burn it into your brains. You got it?<br/>
<br/>
It's a Mercury sable wagon, sure.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Close your eyes. What color is it?<br/>
<br/>
Brown.<br/>
<br/>
Brown.<br/>
<br/>
No, it's medium sandalwood. Keep your eyes closed.<br/>
<br/>
How does the license plate start?<br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
<br/>
Give those gentlemen a gold star.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy Kettleman's her name.<br/>
<br/>
Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50, she comes through here on her way to pick up her kids at Kit Carson Elementary.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you need a place where she's gonna slow down...<br/>
<br/>
Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
All right. Well, there you go. She slows down.<br/>
<br/>
She hangs a right. You come sh**ting out of there.<br/>
<br/>
You do what you did to me. You go ass over teakettle.<br/>
<br/>
You make it a blue-ribbon special.<br/>
<br/>
When she gets out of the car, you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right?<br/>
<br/>
You're the hammer, okay? You get in her face.<br/>
<br/>
You scare the bejesus out of her.<br/>
<br/>
Give me your phone. [Sniffs]<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of busy here, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
[Beeping]<br/>
<br/>
Well, witnesses are good.<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversation] Witnesses are pressure, all right?<br/>
<br/>
Now, once you've got her good and rattled, then you call for an ambulance, but really, you're calling for me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm number one on your speed dial, right next to your weed dealer.<br/>
<br/>
You call me. I hotfoot it over here.<br/>
<br/>
I just "happen" to be driving by.<br/>
<br/>
I stop to see what the trouble is, and this is the most important part... You don't know me.<br/>
<br/>
We've never met. You got it?<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight. We go mano a mano.<br/>
<br/>
You light into me, okay? Get nasty. And no touching.<br/>
<br/>
Leave the hair alone.<br/>
<br/>
But otherwise, you know, open season.<br/>
<br/>
Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag.<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna play it cool, give you back some of the razzmatazz.<br/>
<br/>
And once she's seen the fireworks, you fold like a lawn chair...<br/>
<br/>
Happy ending.<br/>
<br/>
When do we get our money?<br/>
<br/>
After.<br/>
<br/>
After. After.<br/>
<br/>
You get paid when I get paid.<br/>
<br/>
I'm the rising tide that raises all dinghies.<br/>
<br/>
Now, pop quiz... What's the car?<br/>
<br/>
Mercury sable wagon.<br/>
<br/>
Baby-poop brown.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Do you know me?<br/>
<br/>
No. No.<br/>
<br/>
Damn straight. Go with God.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: Well, I'm just glad I happened to be passing by.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to be of help, Betsy. May I call you "Betsy"?<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat] Please, call me "James."<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Oh, the kid will be fine. Don't worry.<br/>
<br/>
He just got his bell rung a little.<br/>
<br/>
I'll... I'll handle that. Oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't think of, uh, taking your money for this.<br/>
<br/>
The embezzlement case?<br/>
<br/>
[Engine turns over]<br/>
<br/>
Mm, yes, I'd... I'd be happy to talk it over.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Oh, shit.<br/>

<br/>
[Crowd murmuring]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Woman</strong>: Call 911.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God! Cal! Cal!<br/>
<br/>
Look at me! Are you okay?!<br/>
<br/>
Buddy, say something. Cal, what are you...<br/>
<br/>
[Groans] Come on already.<br/>
<br/>
What is she doing in there?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Shh.<br/>
<br/>
Is she making a sandwich?<br/>
<br/>
Where's her sense of responsibility?<br/>
<br/>
[Tires squeal]<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
What?!<br/>
<br/>
Hey! What the f...<br/>
<br/>
Funny to run into you, Betsy.<br/>
<br/>
I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
You... You were in accident.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's... [sighing]<br/>
<br/>
Come on.<br/>

<br/>
She what?<br/>
<br/>
It was textbook, man.<br/>
<br/>
We were diamonds, but then she just took off.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, wait. She... She hit-and-run?<br/>
<br/>
That's what I'm saying. She bailed and wailed.<br/>
<br/>
O... okay. Just stay where you are. I'll come get you.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no. Screw that, man.<br/>
<br/>
[Engine sputters]<br/>
<br/>
We're following her.<br/>

You're... How are... You're following her how?<br/>

Okay, okay, okay, new plan... New plan. You<em class="text-italics"> do</em> know me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm<em class="text-italics"> your</em> lawyer. You got that? I'll meet you at the school.<br/>
<br/>
No, she's way past the school.<br/>
<br/>
[Engine grinding]<br/>
<br/>
She hooked a left on Juan tabo, and she's coming into holiday park.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, stay with her.<br/>
<br/>
When she gets where she's going, wherever that is, just don't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
Wait for me.<br/>
<br/>
Wait for what?<br/>
<br/>
You haven't been right even once!<br/>
<br/>
Slippin' Jimmy, my ass!<br/>
<br/>
You fell into the honeypot, kid.<br/>
<br/>
You get it? Hit-and-run is a felony.<br/>
<br/>
So what?<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
"So what?" So more money.<br/>
<br/>
[Engine sputtering]<br/>
<br/>
He says we fell in the honeypot. He says "more money."<br/>
<br/>
So what do we need him for?<br/>
<br/>
Cal? Lars? Whoever... Oh, damn it!<br/>

Holiday park. [Sniffs]<br/>

Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy.<br/>

Open up in the name of the law!<br/>
