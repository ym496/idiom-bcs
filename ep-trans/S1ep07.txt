<br/>
Once again... I do<em class="text-italics"> all</em> the talking.<br/>
<br/>
That's the only way this works.<br/>
<br/>
[Telephone rings in distance]<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
[Footsteps approaching]<br/>
<br/>
Hand it over.<br/>
<br/>
Now, before<em class="text-italics"> that</em> happens...<br/>
<br/>
Hand it over.<br/>
<br/>
No. Hey. I've got it right here.<br/>
<br/>
Is this it?<br/>
<br/>
I'll... I will take that as a "yes."<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Very well. Mystery solved.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I could take you into custody right now, you son of a b*tch.<br/>
<br/>
Both of you.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa. Where's this coming from?<br/>
<br/>
You're the one who spilled the coffee, you ambulance-chasing piece of shit!<br/>
<br/>
Can we dial it down, you know, just a notch?<br/>
<br/>
Look, 45 minutes ago, I'm sound asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut.<br/>
<br/>
He's concerned.<br/>
<br/>
He's getting threatening voicemails from you accusing him of petty theft.<br/>
<br/>
I tell him,<br/>
<br/>
"hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care what the hell time it is. We're gonna go talk this thing out."<br/>
<br/>
And walking across the parking lot, just now... boom... there's a notepad, plain as day, lying on the asphalt, where I can only surmise you accidentally dropped it, Detective. Now, guys, that's... that's all we know.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something, Slick... wait till I get you back to Philadelphia.<br/>
<br/>
I'm confused.<br/>
<br/>
The state of Pennsylvania can extradite people for returning lost property? Wow, that is one bold legislature.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you want to say to me about what you found in here? Hmm?<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's all out in the open?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your daughter-in-law... maybe she's got something to tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we'll see.<br/>
<br/>
First thing tomorrow...<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you got to figure she wouldn't reach out to us if she had nothing to say.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, whatever you are didn't rub off on the rest of your family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome. Let's get the hell out of here.<br/>
<br/>
No, I mean "thanks," as in "three's a crowd."<br/>
<br/>
You can go now.<br/>
<br/>
You're not talking to my client without me.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, he is.<br/>
<br/>
Please leave now.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Smacks lips]<br/>
<br/>
Ooh. Oh, man.<br/>
<br/>
You ever have jet lag?<br/>
<br/>
[Sniffs] I guess that's what this is. [Grunts]<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's the altitude, huh?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Could be the altitude.<br/>
<br/>
We're a mile up, right?<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the kid.<br/>
<br/>
He's young, looking to make his mark.<br/>
<br/>
I like him.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter-in-law... what... what's she gonna tell us?<br/>
<br/>
I don't honestly know.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say, this pretty well ends it here.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe you should talk to her before we do.<br/>
<br/>
I talked.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much.<br/>
<br/>
But... Either way, that's up to her.<br/>
<br/>
That's the least I owe her.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of people we both know that think that Fensky got what was coming to him... Hoffman, too.<br/>
<br/>
That whole precinct was a sewer.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't be surprised if there's a few more early retirements.<br/>
<br/>
Might be a good thing... new blood.<br/>
<br/>
Like the kid.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
He's all right.<br/>
<br/>
He's just got to learn, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
Some rocks you don't turn over.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighing]<br/>
<br/>
What did you say to him?<br/>
<br/>
Let's go, word for word, verbatim, while it's still fresh.<br/>
<br/>
What I said is none of your concern.<br/>
<br/>
I was speaking to a friend.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] You were speaking to a homicide detective who flew 2,000 miles to investigate a double m*rder for which you are clearly the prime suspect.<br/>
<br/>
How could you not recognize the mind games, the scams, the... the con jobs these people play?<br/>
<br/>
You used to be one of them. So what got said?<br/>
<br/>
Right now, come on. I'm serious.<br/>
<br/>
I know you're trying to help me, but you can't go...<br/>
<br/>
Look, no, I'm trying to help<em class="text-italics"> me.</em><br/>
<br/>
Those two Philly cheesesteaks... they want to lock me up right alongside you.<br/>
<br/>
So, work with me here, for the both of us.<br/>
<br/>
You're safe, Counselor, and I no longer require your services.<br/>
<br/>
You're... you're kidding, right?<br/>
<br/>
What... y... you think you're gonna defend yourself?<br/>
<br/>
It's in someone else's hands.<br/>
<br/>
What... like God?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't say Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your help. Go home. Go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Send me your bill.<br/>
<br/>
[Car door closes]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm sending you my bill.<br/>
<br/>
[Engine turns over] I'm sending...<br/>
<br/>
You better believe it!<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Birds chirping]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: It's me... your friendly neighborhood ice man.<br/>
<br/>
There was a run on bacon.<br/>
<br/>
[Ice clatters]<br/>
<br/>
I'll get you next time.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, you there?!<br/>
<br/>
Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
Chuck, you up there?<br/>
<br/>
Hello?<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Chuck</strong>: I'm out here!<br/>
<br/>
Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
... 112, 113, 114...<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit! What are you doing?!<br/>
<br/>
Shh! ... 115, 116, 117, 118, 119... 120! Go! Go! Inside!<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
What the hell was that?<br/>
<br/>
What the hell was that?<br/>
<br/>
Just give me a second.<br/>
<br/>
Ohh.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
It's an experiment, really.<br/>
<br/>
I've been attempting to build up a tolerance for electromagnetic fields.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's like, um, you know, like taking small doses of poison to build up an immunity.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, is that a real thing?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause that does<em class="text-italics"> not</em> sound like a real thing.<br/>
<br/>
It's a real thing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as you well know, there is a 60-kilovolt transformer 200 meters south-southwest of my front yard.<br/>
<br/>
And I've been trying to get acclimated to it.<br/>
<br/>
I got up to two minutes today.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, I could barely stand 30 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to get up to five minutes by next week.<br/>
<br/>
That is just...<br/>
<br/>
Uh, but why now?<br/>
<br/>
Well, after what happened with the police and the hospital, I almost lost everything, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
I can't go on like this.<br/>
<br/>
I have to find a way to get better.<br/>
<br/>
I've got to.<br/>
<br/>
I have to get back to work.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting here, rotting away... this is no kind of life for me... for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I need to be useful again.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Chuck... I am so proud of you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
It'll be a long process, but one to which I'm very much committed.<br/>
<br/>
I have to be.<br/>
<br/>
[Clock ticking]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
God, I... I'll be right back.<br/>
<br/>
I got to get a few more things out of the car.<br/>
<br/>
All right.<br/>
<br/>
[Groans]<br/>
<br/>
Ahh.<br/>
<br/>
Ohh.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[Laughing] All right.<br/>
<br/>
What's all this?<br/>
<br/>
It's just some case files. I'm out of room at the office.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to leave them in the car.<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of sensitive information.<br/>
<br/>
Y... you're not planning to leave them here.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
It'll just be for a little while, okay?<br/>
<br/>
I'm practically sleeping on these things back at my place.<br/>
<br/>
Business is that good?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] It's booming streets of gold.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I'll get these out of here as quick as I can.<br/>
<br/>
I just need to file the 4-13s on some of these wills, and, uh, I'll be out of your hair.<br/>
<br/>
4-13s?<br/>
<br/>
Personal property statements.<br/>
<br/>
You mean 5-13s.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. I was just working with these seniors.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the dementia's contagious, huh? [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
Uh... [clears throat] So, uh, we good here?<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow. Same time.<br/>
<br/>
[Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Birds chirping]<br/>
<br/>
James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801, the suite that's for lease.<br/>
<br/>
Here you go. Just bring them back when you're done.<br/>
<br/>
You got it.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, this is, like... <em class="text-italics">really</em> nice. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Why do you sound surprised?<br/>
<br/>
Not... surprised, no. Just, you know, could you afford this?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?<br/>
<br/>
Those seniors have been very good to me.<br/>
<br/>
I've been meaning to expand, you know?<br/>
<br/>
[Telephone rings]<br/>
<br/>
It's time to invest in myself.<br/>
<br/>
Figure this may be just the place.<br/>
<br/>
Well, won't you miss the nail salon?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I can always visit, you know, get some French tips.<br/>
<br/>
[Elevator bell dings]<br/>
<br/>
[Elevator doors open]<br/>
<br/>
[Lock turns, door opens]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
It's a clean slate. [Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Put the, uh, reception desk right here.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, get some comfortable seating for the clients.<br/>
<br/>
I... it's big... lot of offices.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I like the openness.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I can breathe in here, you know?<br/>
<br/>
It's not some claustrophobic, little closet that smells like acetone.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Room to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Dream big, I say.<br/>
<br/>
[Clicks tongue]<br/>
<br/>
Got a decent-size conference room... not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know, it's cozy. Our elderly brethren prefer that, I find.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Could be cozier, though.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could embroider some little cushions, crochet a runner for the table.<br/>
<br/>
And rocking chairs all around?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Make it look like the front of a cr*cker barrel, huh?<br/>
<br/>
[Both chuckle]<br/>
<br/>
Now you're talking.<br/>
<br/>
This is me.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] I love it.<br/>
<br/>
Got to look successful to<em class="text-italics"> be</em> successful. Am I right?<br/>
<br/>
Well, this definitely looks like success. [Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
Great view.<br/>
<br/>
Get you a big, fancy desk in here.<br/>
<br/>
Cocobolo desk.<br/>
<br/>
A what?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what it means, but I just like saying the word "cocobolo."<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, whatever it is, you deserve it.<br/>
<br/>
And, uh, I want you to see this one.<br/>
<br/>
Here we are.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
This is way better than the other one.<br/>
<br/>
You think?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Who goes in here?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause I'd be all up in here if I were you.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. [Inhales sharply]<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you know, you're right. It is real nice.<br/>
<br/>
It's a corner office. You got to go with the corner office.<br/>
<br/>
Eh, I was saving it for someone.<br/>
<br/>
Who?<br/>
<br/>
Well, my partner.<br/>
<br/>
Your partner? Who's...<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Who would that be?<br/>
<br/>
Well, you said you were interested in elder law.<br/>
<br/>
That's... That is so...<br/>
<br/>
[chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Really.<br/>
<br/>
But you know I've got a lot invested at HHM.<br/>
<br/>
With what's going on now, I... I'm closer than ever to partner... like, maybe two years, and I'm in.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's... it's just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, you know, they put me through law school.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I owe them.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I<em class="text-italics"> do</em> owe them... literally, you know?<br/>
<br/>
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Just, uh, you know, playing with ideas.<br/>
<br/>
So, I had the extra office and everything, so...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. No, I get it. It's...<br/>
<br/>
I... want to see the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Wow!<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
They have stainless in here.<br/>
<br/>
I don't even have stainless at home.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: I know this is the last thing you want to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I think your chances of getting a favorable ruling from a jury are very slim.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Mr. Kettleman</strong>: What does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
We're not in a great position to win at trial.<br/>
<br/>
But we came to you people because we were told you win cases.<br/>
<br/>
Winning doesn't always mean getting a favorable verdict at trial.<br/>
<br/>
We try to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, given each individual case.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, we've worked very hard to stave off an arrest.<br/>
<br/>
After the misunderstanding about your, uh, camping trip, the D.A. was concerned you might be a flight risk.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] A flight risk? We... we were practically in our own backyard. [Laughs]<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly what we told the D.A.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I think we've managed to come up with a deal that is very favorable under the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
A deal?<br/>
<br/>
I hate that terminology.<br/>
<br/>
A deal is what they got O.J.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Betsy, maybe we should, you know, hear it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just saying, it's terrible term.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of... deal?<br/>
<br/>
If the prosecution decides to file, which is definitely the direction this seems to be headed, and if they choose to stack charges, Craig, you're looking at 30 years in prison.<br/>
<br/>
30 years?<br/>
<br/>
That's the maximum, and given the nature of the charge and the current political environment, I'd say we should expect it.<br/>
<br/>
The public outcry in cases like these is a big factor.<br/>
<br/>
However, after much discussion with the D.A., who is also invested in keeping the press to a minimum, we have arrived at an arrangement, which would include 16 months in a county facility.<br/>
<br/>
16 months.<br/>
<br/>
Down from 30 years.<br/>
<br/>
And you most likely wouldn't serve all of it.<br/>
<br/>
But he would have to say he was guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Admitting wrongdoing and making the county whole again goes a long way here... hence the minimal sentence.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, "making the county whole again"?<br/>
<br/>
It includes the stipulation that you return $1.6 million in misappropriated funds.<br/>
<br/>
Give back the money?<br/>
<br/>
But there is no money.<br/>
<br/>
There's no money.<br/>
<br/>
We told you... Craig is innocent.<br/>
<br/>
I understand.<br/>
<br/>
However, I'd like to emphasize again that this deal is Craig's best chance of minimizing jail time.<br/>
<br/>
You're telling us there are drug dealers and murderers walking the streets, but instead of going after them, they want to put an innocent man in jail.<br/>
<br/>
There's no other... way?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. I think, under the circumstances, this is your best option.<br/>
<br/>
Murderers and rapists, and this is how they tr...<br/>
<br/>
[inhales sharply]<br/>
<br/>
Okay. There is no money.<br/>
<br/>
There never was.<br/>
<br/>
You have to take this to trial.<br/>
<br/>
Look, you have a difficult, but nevertheless straightforward choice to make here.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, you give up the money, Ah! plead...<br/>
<br/>
I just told you... there is no money.<br/>
<br/>
... plead guilty... it's painful, I know... and go to jail for a year and a half.<br/>
<br/>
But your other choice... that is no choice at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to trial, you'll most likely lose, and Craig goes to prison for decades.<br/>
<br/>
Your children will grow up seeing their dad through bars on visiting day.<br/>
<br/>
I know what I'd do.<br/>
<br/>
I'd take the deal.<br/>
<br/>
Two years from now, you can be starting over.<br/>
<br/>
It's tough, I know... But you're tough people.<br/>
<br/>
And your family is worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't I give you a few moments to discuss this?<br/>
<br/>
I know it's a big decision.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need to discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
You're fired.<br/>
<br/>
How about we go to<em class="text-italics"> my</em> office and discuss this?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there's a solution.<br/>
<br/>
That won't be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
We will no longer be requiring your services.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's not personal, really.<br/>
<br/>
If you're unhappy with what we presented to you, there may be other directions we can go.<br/>
<br/>
We're done here! Please stop following us!<br/>
<br/>
Don't look back.<br/>
<br/>
Only look forward. Always in life, look forward.<br/>
<br/>
[Bingo balls rattling]<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: O-70! O-70! Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
70's a good age.<br/>
<br/>
All right, duck your heads, 'cause here comes another number.<br/>
<br/>
N-32.<br/>
<br/>
And the action never stops.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all took your heart pills,<br/>
<br/>
'cause it's almost too much excitement, right?<br/>
<br/>
Which one will it be?<br/>
<br/>
Say your prayers. Here it comes.<br/>
<br/>
All right, we've got G-48...<br/>
<br/>
"G," as in "Guy Lombardo."<br/>
<br/>
G-48.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your elbows to yourselves, okay? No body-checking.<br/>
<br/>
All right, what do we have here?<br/>
<br/>
Wait for it.<br/>
<br/>
B-6.<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
Lucky B-6, just like the vitamin... all right... which you should be taking.<br/>
<br/>
Keep things moving in the old G.I. tract.<br/>
<br/>
Bingo!<br/>
<br/>
[Bell dings] Oh, we have a winner!<br/>
<br/>
[Applause] Lady luck has struck again.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see a hand so we know who's won.<br/>
<br/>
It's the lovely young lady in the back.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations, Miss. You've won a, um... what do we have for the lovely lady?<br/>
<br/>
Notebook.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.<br/>
<br/>
Do you like cats, Miss, uh...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Irene. I love kitties.<br/>
<br/>
I have two siamese cats...<br/>

[Cellphone ringing]<br/>
<br/>
Oscar and Felix.<br/>
<br/>
Felix can wash himself.<br/>
<br/>
Oscar won't. He he just won't.<br/>
<br/>
What a lovely story. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Um, can you take that to Irene?<br/>
<br/>
And when you come back, cover... yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I'm gonna take a short break,<br/>
<br/>
'cause somebody needs legal help.<br/>

[High-pitched British accent] Offices of James McGill, esquire.<br/>
<br/>
How may I direct your call?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes, of course. Um, one moment, please.<br/>
<br/>
[Normal voice] Déjà vu. Hello, again.<br/>
<br/>
Good to see you.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see you.<br/>
<br/>
So, how may I be of service?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we would like to hire you as our attorney, Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles] Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>
However, we have certain conditions, and these are not up for debate.<br/>
<br/>
We want no jail time... zero.<br/>
<br/>
Craig is innocent, and we expect you to prove that.<br/>
<br/>
We won't see his name smeared like this any longer.<br/>
<br/>
Um, can we back up just a scooch?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause last time we spoke, you were very enthusiastic... you were positively insistent about being represented by HHM.<br/>
<br/>
Well, uh...<br/>
<br/>
That's all right. Oh.<br/>
<br/>
We've parted ways.<br/>
<br/>
May I ask why?<br/>
<br/>
We... disagreed with their defense strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
They treated us like we were guilty.<br/>
<br/>
So, your previous objections to my representing you are now...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm sorry about my è bluntness at our last encounter. è [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunate.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I...<br/>
<br/>
But we really... we're very sorry about that.<br/>
<br/>
We thought long and hard about it, and, um, we...<br/>
<br/>
And, you know, given your passion and your can-do attitude...<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
... we really... we just believe that you're the lawyer for us.<br/>
<br/>
For us, yes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, as flattered as I am by this, um, since we last spoke, I've changed my area of specialization, so I concentrate on elder law now.<br/>
<br/>
But, I mean, you said that you would fight for us.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you... You, you were you were adamant.<br/>
<br/>
You promised to get us a not-guilty verdict.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I exactly<em class="text-italics"> promised</em> that.<br/>
<br/>
You said we would be client number one, morning, noon, or night, and...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and I meant what I said, at the time, but times change.<br/>
<br/>
But we've already paid you a retainer.<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
A retainer.<br/>
<br/>
That<em class="text-italics"> is</em> what you called it.<br/>
<br/>
That was your specific terminology.<br/>
<br/>
It... could you excuse me for a moment?<br/>
<br/>
I, uh, had a big gulp on the way over.<br/>
<br/>
Ohh.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Kim</strong>: Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, there.<br/>
<br/>
[Urinating stops]<br/>
<br/>
[Urinating resumes]<br/>
<br/>
Funny story.<br/>
<br/>
I found something that belongs to you... again.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? What?<br/>
<br/>
"Who?"<br/>
<br/>
Picture "The 25th Hour," starring Ned and Maude Flanders.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Christ. The Kettlemans?<br/>
<br/>
You lose any<em class="text-italics"> other</em> clients today?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo Bananas just offered me the plum job of defending them.<br/>
<br/>
They came to you?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what you did to piss them off, but it must have been good.<br/>
<br/>
W... what did they tell you?<br/>
<br/>
Not much, just, uh, that you treated them like they were guilty.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
Look, Jimmy...<br/>
<br/>
I know... [Inhales deeply] I know this is a lot to ask, but you have to convince them to come back to HHM.<br/>
<br/>
I do, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
[Urinal flushes]<br/>
<br/>
Please. It's important.<br/>
<br/>
What's it worth to you?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, I'm serious.<br/>
<br/>
They left because they think they can win this case, but they can't.<br/>
<br/>
I managed to scrape together... from practically nothing, I might add... a deal they should feel lucky to have.<br/>
<br/>
This is their absolute best bet.<br/>
<br/>
Please... Make them understand it's better for them if they come back.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about this deal.<br/>
<br/>
Elder law?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what that is.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, me neither.<br/>
<br/>
Elder. Do you think... Maybe if we were old...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. Whoo! Oh.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
The mysteries of the bladder. Right?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
So, how do we get started?<br/>
<br/>
Do you need us to sign that little paper?<br/>
<br/>
I am... I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case.<br/>
<br/>
My schedule is just... it's just chock-full right now.<br/>
<br/>
I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.<br/>
<br/>
I'm certain they would welcome you with open arms.<br/>
<br/>
No, we're not going back there. They were... incompatible.<br/>
<br/>
I understand.<br/>
<br/>
They asked you to face some harsh realities, and I get it... no one likes that. But bottom line here... Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.<br/>
<br/>
She has a great relationship with the D.A.<br/>
<br/>
Much as I'd love to sing my own praises, I doubt I could get you a deal as good as the one she already has.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we don't want a deal.<br/>
<br/>
We want you, our lawyer, to exonerate Craig.<br/>
<br/>
"Exonerate"?<br/>
<br/>
That is, uh... that is a big word, particularly in your case.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, there will be no deal.<br/>
<br/>
There is no money with which to make a deal. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
We... can we all three just parachute down from cloud cuckoo land?<br/>
<br/>
'Cause we know, without question, there<em class="text-italics"> is</em> money.<br/>
<br/>
No, there...<br/>
<br/>
I distinctly remember a spirited game of tug-of-w*r <em class="text-italics">over</em> this money, money which we then discussed at length.<br/>
<br/>
You made many excuses justifying your possession of said money.<br/>
<br/>
It's there.<br/>
<br/>
It exists. S-shh. Now, just... [Stammers] please, for my own sanity...<br/>
<br/>
[Clears throat] You can't hide a big bag of cash forever, and you certainly will never be able to spend any of it.<br/>
<br/>
So, go back to HHM, apologize to Ms. Wexler, and for Christ's sakes, take the deal.<br/>
<br/>
If there were any money...<br/>
<br/>
Lady, enough!<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">If</em> there were any money, there would have to be a full accounting of it.<br/>
<br/>
Every penny would have to be present... every single penny.<br/>
<br/>
You understand?<br/>
<br/>
All of it.<br/>
<br/>
That includes the $30,000 that you...<br/>
<br/>
Craig, yes, he gets it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Yeah, he gets it.<br/>
<br/>
We're in this together, Mr. McGill... Come what may.<br/>
<br/>
Now [Breathes deeply] where do we begin?<br/>
<br/>
[Telephones ringing]<br/>
<br/>
[Indistinct conversations]<br/>
<br/>
There you go. Kettleman that's all of it.<br/>
<br/>
Where's Kim?<br/>
<br/>
We moved her over to the east wing.<br/>
<br/>
The east wing? That's the cornfield.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you sending her to the cornfield, Howard?<br/>
<br/>
Never heard it called<em class="text-italics"> that</em> before.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckling] Well, that's what you call it.<br/>
<br/>
You gonna punish her just 'cause you lost those two batshit Kettlemans?<br/>
<br/>
You notice I'm not exactly crowing over how I snaked them away from you.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, here are your files.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs] I'm gonna need some help here.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
<br/>
You sure are.<br/>
<br/>
[Grunting]<br/>
<br/>
[Breathing heavily]<br/>
<br/>
That prick firing you?<br/>
<br/>
Best-case scenario is my 2-year plan just became a 10-year plan.<br/>
<br/>
That schmuck.<br/>
<br/>
You didn't do anything wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I lost the client.<br/>
<br/>
Not your fault.<br/>
<br/>
They're not really playing with a full deck those Kettlemans.<br/>
<br/>
You had to take their case?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, okay? I tried. I r... I really did.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not being fair.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you tried.<br/>
<br/>
They'll do what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Hope you didn't promise them too much.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you'll be able to do more for them than we were offering.<br/>
<br/>
You think very highly of my skills, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case.<br/>
<br/>
That deal was their best chance.<br/>
<br/>
After I worked my ass off finagling with the D.A., and it's just like... whatever.<br/>
<br/>
There's got to be a way, you know?<br/>
<br/>
I take it to court.<br/>
<br/>
You'll lose.<br/>
<br/>
Kettleman did a terrible job covering his tracks.<br/>
<br/>
For starters, they've got reams of checks he wrote for false expenses.<br/>
<br/>
And I can't even challenge their admission into evidence because he wrote them to himself.<br/>
<br/>
I know we're never supposed to say our clients are guilty, but, hey, not my client anymore... he's guilty as sin.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but there has to be something... some loophole or...<br/>
<br/>
None that I could find.<br/>
<br/>
There has to be a way.<br/>
<br/>
Not without the money.<br/>
<br/>
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have, and they refuse to play it.<br/>

"The right thing."<br/>

Oh, it's Mr. McGill!<br/>
<br/>
Good morning. Come on in. [Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
[Door closes]<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I was here, it was, uh, well, not a contender for the cover of<em class="text-italics"> good housekeeping... </em> that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles]<br/>
<br/>
Do you have news about our case?<br/>
<br/>
I do, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<br/>
<br/>
Ah.<br/>
<br/>
We told you... there will be no deal.<br/>
<br/>
You did, didn't you?<br/>
<br/>
However, circumstances have changed.<br/>
<br/>
What circumstances?<br/>
<br/>
To answer that, um, might I suggest that you go check on that money you insist you didn't take?<br/>
<br/>
[Chuckles, scoffs]<br/>
<br/>
In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?<br/>
<br/>
Wait. How could you...<br/>
<br/>
[Rapid footsteps depart]<br/>
<br/>
Betsy!<br/>
<br/>
[Clattering]<br/>
<br/>
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!<br/>
<br/>
It's okay. It's okay, Betsy. It's got to be...<br/>
<br/>
No. It's got to be in there somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
[Thudding]<br/>
<br/>
What did you do with it?<br/>
<br/>
By "it," you mean...<br/>
<br/>
Where is it?!<br/>
<br/>
Oh. You mean the money.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, let me see. Uh, it's, uh, on its way to the D.A.'s desk right about now.<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
You... oh, you thief!<br/>
<br/>
Takes one to know one, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
He took it?<br/>
<br/>
How did you take it?<br/>
<br/>
A good magician never reveals his secrets.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's what we're gonna do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you don't tell us what to do.<br/>
<br/>
You stole from us. We'll... we will have you arrested.<br/>
<br/>
I... I can see how upset you are, and, even on a good day, you and logic are... [whistles]<br/>
<br/>
But think about what you just said.<br/>
<br/>
Criminals have no recourse. And you two... you're criminals, big-time.<br/>
<br/>
How dare you?<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer who has found a way to minimize the damage you've brought upon yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
[Scoffs] Oh. Oh, you're fired.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I quit already.<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you're gonna go back to her, you're gonna apologize for your hasty decision to terminate her services, and you're gonna fall on her mercy and take that deal.<br/>
<br/>
We'll tell... about the bribe you took.<br/>
<br/>
You could do that.<br/>
<br/>
You absolutely could.<br/>
<br/>
And I'd be in a mess of trouble... a real pickle...<br/>
<br/>
But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman.<br/>
<br/>
'Cause right now, only Mr. Kettleman is on the hook for the whole embezzlement kerfuffle.<br/>
<br/>
But the bribe... w... we're back to calling it a bribe?...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that implicates you, as well.<br/>
<br/>
It does not.<br/>
<br/>
It was all me.<br/>
<br/>
No, it wasn't.<br/>
<br/>
I'll make sure everyone knows that.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
Look on the bright side, you know?<br/>
<br/>
They could work out some kind of inter-prison visitation program, the occasional conjugal.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it won't be all bad.<br/>
<br/>
You... you'll probably wind up running your own g*ng.<br/>
<br/>
Thing you folks need to know about me... I got nothing to lose.<br/>
<br/>
Christ, you should see my office.<br/>
<br/>
No, it's not over.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Let's find another lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Betsy.<br/>
<br/>
No, no.<br/>
<br/>
[Sighs]<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
We don't have to put up with this.<br/>
<br/>
I will<em class="text-italics"> not</em> be treated this way.<br/>

Betsy... The kids.<br/>
