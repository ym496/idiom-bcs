<br/>
- You okay?<br/>
<br/>
 - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, she's gonna hate you when this is over.<br/>
<br/>
 I came because I thought it was the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
 You've been sold a bill of goods, Rebecca.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy: Which of us you believe depends on how we all understand - the mind of Charles McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Don't you know by now this is real?<br/>
<br/>
 Could you reach into your breast pocket?<br/>

<br/>
 Hey, my father's gonna bring in his Corolla.<br/>
<br/>
 His dogs tore up the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
 Like, ate the stuffing.<br/>

<br/>

 Who works for who, huh?<br/>

 Domino: Nacho!<br/>

<br/>
 No, no!<br/>

<br/>
 Nacho, no!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 - No, please.<br/>
<br/>
 [Grunts.]<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Kim: I want to start by sincerely thanking you for your patience through this long and emotional proceeding.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly to build a practice that helps an underserved and frankly overlooked segment of our community the elderly.<br/>
<br/>
 You've heard from many of Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 McGill's clients today.<br/>
<br/>
 Every one of them came here gladly in support of their lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<br/>
<br/>
 He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<br/>
<br/>
 He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.<br/>
<br/>
 Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.<br/>
<br/>
 Dropping everything to care for his brother through multiple hospitalizations.<br/>
<br/>
 Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicle door slides open.]<br/>
<br/>
 And yet, during this time, Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother - grew to epic proportions.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Vehicle departs.]<br/>
<br/>
 So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative Jimmy snapped.<br/>
<br/>
 Wouldn't you?<br/>
<br/>
 I might.<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck?<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill understands he broke the law when he forced his way into his brother's house, and he is deeply sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 He's more than ready to face the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 However, as to ethical violation 16-304 (A), the State Bar's claim of destruction of evidence it categorically did not happen.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy McGill had no premeditated agenda when he entered his brother's home.<br/>
<br/>
 - He lost his temper - Chuck, please!<br/>
<br/>
 - plain and simple.<br/>
<br/>
 - Please let me in!<br/>
<br/>
 So now the question you must ask yourselves is this Is the legal profession better with Jimmy McGill in it?<br/>
<br/>
 I believe the answer is a resounding yes.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Cork pops.]<br/>
<br/>
 Oh!<br/>
<br/>
 - Kim: Geez!<br/>
<br/>
 - Here's to 12 short months.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Laughs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Also, somebody call the Pope because according to your summation, I oughta be a saint.<br/>
<br/>
 Me and Mother Teresa.<br/>
<br/>
 Right up there with her.<br/>
<br/>
 St.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, has a nice ring to it.<br/>
<br/>
 Boom.<br/>
<br/>
 Ahhh.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles, inhales.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs, chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 So have you given any thought to what you're gonna do for the next year you know, with your clients?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Whoa!<br/>
<br/>
 Slow down.<br/>
<br/>
 That is tomorrow talk, Counselor.<br/>
<br/>
 Tonight, I celebrate with the world's best defense attorney.<br/>
<br/>
 Where are your notes?<br/>
<br/>
 Let's, uh, spread 'em out and roll around on 'em, - see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Laughs.]<br/>
<br/>
 It's a good plan.<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Knocking continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Knocking continues.]<br/>
<br/>
 Rebecca?<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 - Well, I'm Come on in, please.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Door closes.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, Kim Wexler.<br/>
<br/>
 - Rebecca Bois.<br/>
<br/>
 We didn't formally meet earlier.<br/>
<br/>
 - Right.<br/>
<br/>
 It's nice to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, I-I was, uh, just at Chuck's, and he won't answer the door.<br/>
<br/>
 I-I was out there knocking for almost an hour.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 That sounds like Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sure he's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 He's just being dramatic.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, well, I think it's a little bit more than that.<br/>
<br/>
 I want you to come with me to get him to let us in.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, he needs our help.<br/>
<br/>
 No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
 I I've already kicked my door in for the year.<br/>
<br/>
 You owe it to him.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't owe him squat.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, you lied to me.<br/>
<br/>
 This was never about helping Chuck.<br/>
<br/>
 If you feel misled, I apologize, but I think I was clear.<br/>
<br/>
 I told you I had to defend myself and Chuck would need help afterwards, which he does.<br/>
<br/>
 You got what you wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 Now it's time to do what's right.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah No.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy, he's still your brother.<br/>
<br/>
 [Smacks lips.]<br/>
<br/>
 Not anymore, he's not.<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck was right about you all along.<br/>
<br/>
 He's mentally ill.<br/>
<br/>
 What is your excuse?<br/>
<br/>
 Enjoy your champagne.<br/>
<br/>
 [Footsteps depart.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door opens.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door closes.]<br/>
<br/>
 Like the other night during dinner, Kaylee asked if her daddy ever used to cook.<br/>
<br/>
 And I told her about how Matty used to make her Mickey Mouse pancakes on weekends.<br/>
<br/>
 You know, two small pancake ears attached to a big one?<br/>
<br/>
 She didn't remember, but I think it made her happy.<br/>
<br/>
 She even asked for them the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Boy, Matty made it look easy.<br/>
<br/>
 And keeping the ears separated is really hard.<br/>
<br/>
 Mine looked terrible.<br/>
<br/>
 But Kaylee didn't care.<br/>
<br/>
 Now she wants "Daddy pancakes" every weekend.<br/>
<br/>
 [Light laughter.]<br/>
<br/>
 But there are times Career day's coming up, and she asked me if I would go and talk about her daddy's job.<br/>
<br/>
 She wants to know more about what he did.<br/>
<br/>
 And that kind of took my breath away.<br/>
<br/>
 Kaylee's teacher thinks it would be good for her, maybe make his absence feel a little bit more normal.<br/>
<br/>
 Man: So, do you think you're gonna do it?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
 - Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
 - Good.<br/>
<br/>
 That's good work, Stacey.<br/>
<br/>
 So, who's next?<br/>
<br/>
 Stacey: Thanks for coming.<br/>
<br/>
 It means a lot.<br/>
<br/>
 Mike: Well, honey, if it makes you feel any better, I'm all for it.<br/>
<br/>
 Enough that you'd come again?<br/>
<br/>
 [Engine starts.]<br/>
<br/>
 - We'll see.<br/>
<br/>
 - Well thing is, I sort of volunteered you for something.<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 To help with the new playground.<br/>
<br/>
 The kids deserve way better than that, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
 Sure, but why me?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, they need someone who knows how to pour concrete.<br/>
<br/>
 And the slide and the swings need something called footings, I think.<br/>
<br/>
 Sweetheart, that's not really my department.<br/>
<br/>
 Sure it is, Pop.<br/>
<br/>
 You built a carport when Matty was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
 I did?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 He told me about it a bunch of times.<br/>
<br/>
 He said that when you were pricing it out, you thought that all the people who gave you quotes were crooks, [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 so you decided to do it yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 And you let Matty write his initials in the wet cement.<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicle departs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Pop, the way he talked about you, it was like you hung the moon.<br/>
<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 I can get you out of it.<br/>
<br/>
 - I just thought it was - No, it's fine.<br/>
<br/>
 - Just tell me when and where.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Laughs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
<br/>
 Geez.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sniffles.]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Engine shuts off.]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Dog barking in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Crickets chirping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Mailbox door creaks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clattering.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck?!<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clock ticking.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Dog barking in distance.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck, it's Howard!<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not leaving, Chuck!<br/>
<br/>
 I don't want to wake up the neighbors, but I got all night!<br/>
<br/>
 [Knock on door.]<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck?!<br/>
<br/>
 [Clock ticking.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Footsteps depart.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Insects chirping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Doorknob rattles.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuck sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Gas hissing.]<br/>
<br/>
 That is a 35-year-old Macallan.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not gonna tell you how much it cost, but don't worry it's coming out of my end.<br/>
<br/>
 The opinion came in.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy was suspended for 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
 This is a win, my friend.<br/>
<br/>
 I know, it doesn't feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
 But hear me out.<br/>
<br/>
 Jimmy's not gonna be a lawyer for one year.<br/>
<br/>
 And if he screws up, which we both know is likely, his PPD terminates and that one year may turn into forever.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clock ticking, gas hissing.]<br/>
<br/>
 Chuck, you're at a crossroads.<br/>
<br/>
 You can keep looking backwards, stay focused on your brother, what he's up to, or you can go forward.<br/>
<br/>
 And, Chuck, listen to me Jimmy's just not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
 Where would we be if say, Clarence Darrow had devoted the best years of his life to supervising his ne'er-do-well relatives?<br/>
<br/>
 Think of the cases he wouldn't have taken, the injustices that would have gone unanswered.<br/>
<br/>
 What a waste.<br/>
<br/>
 I say put your energy into the future.<br/>
<br/>
 [Cork pops softly.]<br/>
<br/>
 Anything else is a waste of your time and intellect.<br/>
<br/>
 What do you say?<br/>
<br/>
 [Sniffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Clock ticking, gas hissing.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 To new beginnings.<br/>
<br/>
 To new beginnings.<br/>
<br/>
 Mmm.<br/>
<br/>
 You okay to drive?<br/>
<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
 How are you feeling?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, I'm fine.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you, Howard.<br/>
<br/>
 [Lock clicks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Vehicle door closes, engine starts.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathing heavily.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Grunts.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Breathing heavily.]<br/>
<br/>
 Ohh.<br/>
<br/>
 [Water bubbling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Lunch is served.<br/>
<br/>
 Swim, honey.<br/>
<br/>
 Get it before it's soggy.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Francesca, it's go time!<br/>
<br/>
 Francesca: Where do you wanna start?<br/>
<br/>
 With the A's.<br/>
<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
<br/>
 Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Adamson?<br/>
<br/>
 It's Francesca at Jimmy McGill's office.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Are you available to talk with Jimmy?<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Great.<br/>
<br/>
 Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Adamson.<br/>
<br/>
 Hello, dear.<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have a moment?<br/>
<br/>
 I just wanted you to be the first to know, uh, that I'll be taking a brief sabbatical from the law, just one year.<br/>
<br/>
 One quick trip of the Earth around the Sun, and I'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
 I will.<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 - Hold for Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Telephone beeps.]<br/>
<br/>
 I did?<br/>
<br/>
 Aww, that's that's that's an honor.<br/>
<br/>
 And how did he pass?<br/>
<br/>
 Next!<br/>
<br/>
 The details will all be in a letter you'll receive shortly.<br/>
<br/>
 Mostly legal boilerplate.<br/>
<br/>
 Now, you give that nephew a hug for me.<br/>
<br/>
 Niece!<br/>
<br/>
 Next!<br/>
<br/>
 - Hold for Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 - [Telephone beeps.]<br/>
<br/>
 It's just a technical thing, really.<br/>
<br/>
 It's, uh It's just a technical, uh an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
 It's an agreement It's an agreement that I came to with the Bar Association, and you're gonna get a letter with all the details, so Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Levine, can you hear me?!<br/>
<br/>
 Hello?!<br/>
<br/>
 Can you hear me still?!<br/>
<br/>
 Okay, just You stop for You stop talking, and then I'll talk.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 The letter will explain it, but the the details are just boring legalistic mumbo-jumbo.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't know where those sounds are coming from, sir.<br/>
<br/>
 You you'll have to check.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, then, stay inside!<br/>
<br/>
 Details will be in a letter that's right, but d-don't worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 Next!<br/>
<br/>
 Next.<br/>
<br/>
 Next!<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, Mrs.<br/>
<br/>
 Pressman, I still have the document.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm including the calico.<br/>
<br/>
 Now I don't wanna get down into the weeds on this with you, sir.<br/>
<br/>
 It's just my headache, sir.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm tired.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen to you.<br/>
<br/>
 Where'd you learn so much about lawyering?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, just watch your mail for that letter from my office.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye-bye.<br/>
<br/>
 - Next!<br/>
<br/>
 - Last one, Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Yalowitz.<br/>
<br/>
 Last one.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Telephone beeps.]<br/>
<br/>
 Mr.<br/>
<br/>
 Yalowitz.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey, it's Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
 Listen, for your future lawyering needs, I am taking a hiatus of one year.<br/>
<br/>
 Will you please watch your mail for a letter from my office?<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, Jimmy from TV.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 You watch it every day, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 Really?<br/>
<br/>
 Were you the pilot of the B-29?<br/>
<br/>
 32 missions?<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Holy Well, c-can I just say, sir, that you are one of the people who made the greatest generation so damn great?<br/>
<br/>
 I salute you.<br/>
<br/>
 A'ight, see you soon.<br/>
<br/>
 On TV, right.<br/>
<br/>
 Bye.<br/>
<br/>
 [Receiver clicks.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Water bubbling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Francesca, get me KWBV!<br/>
<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Telephone buttons clicking.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Telephone beeps.]<br/>
<br/>
 Get me the manager.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Then get me somebody who can pull a commercial, stat!<br/>
<br/>
 [Crickets chirping.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 You finish making your calls?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 That was a ton of fun.<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 But what gets me is this.<br/>
<br/>
 What is it?<br/>
<br/>
 It is my KWBV contract.<br/>
<br/>
 I almost let one of my ads run today.<br/>
<br/>
 You can't do that.<br/>
<br/>
 I know, but can you believe this?<br/>
<br/>
 I've got nine airings left.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm out 4,000 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
 [Scoffs.]<br/>
<br/>
 I guess you have to find a local business and try to sell 'em your time.<br/>
<br/>
 - What else can you do?<br/>
<br/>
 - [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 This pile of garbage explicitly states I'm not allowed to resell.<br/>
<br/>
 You're a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
 See if you can find a loophole.<br/>
<br/>
 I cannot look at another contract.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm up to my eyeballs in Mesa Verde.<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 So, what do you want to do about Francesca?<br/>
<br/>
 [Clears throat.]<br/>
<br/>
 Do about her?<br/>
<br/>
 What?<br/>
<br/>
 Yeah, how much notice should we give her?<br/>
<br/>
 Two weeks?<br/>
<br/>
 Well, we're not doing her any favors by keeping her in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
 She should start looking.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 So you want to fire Francesca?<br/>
<br/>
 I don't want to, but I don't need her for more than filing and getting coffee, [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 and I can do that myself.<br/>
<br/>
 We just hired her.<br/>
<br/>
 I like her.<br/>
<br/>
 While we're on the subject, we need to talk about the overhead on this place.<br/>
<br/>
 No, Kim, no!<br/>
<br/>
 This office is set up for two legal practices, and now there's only one.<br/>
<br/>
 I don't need all this space.<br/>
<br/>
 I only have one client.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 It's a huge client!<br/>
<br/>
 I looked into it, and breaking the lease will cost a hell of a lot less than 10 months' rent.<br/>
<br/>
 No, we didn't go through all this just to give up everything after one day of suspension.<br/>
<br/>
 One day!<br/>
<br/>
 It's not everything.<br/>
<br/>
 It's an office.<br/>
<br/>
 Four walls and a door.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 Why waste money on something w-we don't need?<br/>
<br/>
 As as far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed, all right?<br/>
<br/>
 I'll hold up my end, you hold up yours.<br/>
<br/>
 50-50.<br/>
<br/>
 So you're gonna keep paying for half a law office even though you're not practicing law?<br/>
<br/>
 - Call it "aspirational thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 " - Okay.<br/>
<br/>
 But how are you gonna pay for it?<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 The day I don't show up with my half, that's the day we'll talk about closing this place.<br/>
<br/>
 That's fair, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
 You'll see.<br/>
<br/>
 [Door opens.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Door closes.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 Look at the two of you.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, you belong on TV!<br/>
<br/>
 You're naturals!<br/>
<br/>
 I know.<br/>
<br/>
 You're thinking it's too good to be true.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, "TV's too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 We can't afford that.<br/>
<br/>
 " Well, I'm telling you, you can.<br/>
<br/>
 And here's the beauty part for a reasonable price, we will sh**t your commercial, and then we'll throw in the airtime for the low, low price of free.<br/>
<br/>
 Hey!<br/>
<br/>
 Gimme Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
<br/>
 That's me!<br/>
<br/>
 You've seen my ad!<br/>
<br/>
 Well, what I did for me, my friends, I will do that for you.<br/>
<br/>
 Look, our all-inclusive Premium package that's gonna be the best bang for your buck.<br/>
<br/>
 We'll sh**t nine commercials for $4,900.<br/>
<br/>
 Okay?<br/>
<br/>
 And that includes the nine airings at 3:20 in the afternoon on channel KWBV.<br/>
<br/>
 That is a prime slot with a viewership of tens of thousands of potential customers.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales deeply.]<br/>
<br/>
 - It does sound like a good deal.<br/>
<br/>
 - It does.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a lot of money.<br/>
<br/>
 Well that's that's perfectly understandable.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a big financial commitment.<br/>
<br/>
 Uh, that's why we have our, uh, "Toe-in-the-Water" package.<br/>
<br/>
 That's, uh, one commercial, flat rate, $849.<br/>
<br/>
 95.<br/>
<br/>
 Beauty part again free airtime.<br/>
<br/>
 And when this thing runs, you're gonna get calls I can promise you that.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 We'll think about it.<br/>
<br/>
 Excellent.<br/>
<br/>
 When, uh, do you think you might decide?<br/>
<br/>
 - Maybe next week.<br/>
<br/>
 - Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
<br/>
 Gee, I'm sorry for any confusion, but I was talk I was talking about, uh a much shorter window for the thinking part.<br/>
<br/>
 How short?<br/>
<br/>
 We would have you on the air by 3:20 this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckling.]<br/>
<br/>
 Today?<br/>
<br/>
 You're gonna sh**t a commercial in the next 2 1/2 hours?<br/>
<br/>
 Oh, no.<br/>
<br/>
 [Chuckles.]<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, there's a whole post process.<br/>
<br/>
 I mean, there's editing and mixing, coloring, layback.<br/>
<br/>
 It's a whole megillah.<br/>
<br/>
 You don't want to know.<br/>
<br/>
 But we would need to be sh**ting in the next 15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
 [Bell dings.]<br/>
<br/>
 Woman: Now, there's "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.<br/>
<br/>
 " Man: Why don't they make, like, a Moses musical?<br/>
<br/>
 - Man #2: They did.<br/>
<br/>
 - They did.<br/>
<br/>
 Which one was that?<br/>
<br/>
 It was "Let My People Go"?<br/>
<br/>
 No.<br/>
<br/>
 Well, yeah, it was kind of Jimmy: Everybody get in the car.<br/>
<br/>
 [Inhales sharply.]<br/>
<br/>
 [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 - [Sighs.]<br/>
<br/>
 - Is is everything okay?<br/>
<br/>
 No!<br/>
<br/>
 I air in 2 hours and 20 minutes, and I have no client.<br/>
<br/>
 That's another 400 bucks down the drain.<br/>
<br/>
 How do I find somebody who needs a commercial and can afford one?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 Well, you better think again!<br/>
<br/>
 You can't afford not to be on TV!<br/>

<br/>
 You're a star!<br/>
