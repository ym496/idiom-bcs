<div class="content">Works every... I'm telling you, every time.<br/>
<br/>
Do it, try it.<br/>
<br/>
What? Right now?<br/>
<br/>
All right, all right. (Howls)<br/>
<br/>
Kind of... Kind of that.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Got to work on it, bro.<br/>
<br/>
All right, man.<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
All right, bro, I'll work on it.<br/>
<br/>
But... just, like, when... when do you know...<br/>
<br/>
Right before the cork pops, you know?<br/>
<br/>
(Laughs)<br/>
<br/>
Timing's important, but...<br/>
<br/>
But you don't do it, like... in her ear.<br/>
<br/>
No, you don't do it in her ear.<br/>
<br/>
Because... yeah.<br/>
<br/>
It's a given you don't do it in her ear.<br/>
<br/>
But this is, like, scientifically proven, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Really?<br/>
<br/>
This is, like, prehistoric stuff.<br/>
<br/>
(Laughs) Crazy, man.<br/>
<br/>
It's like the medulla, the wolf brain.<br/>
<br/>
The what?<br/>
<br/>
It's primitive stuff...<br/>
<br/>
All right, let me try it again.<br/>
<br/>
(Howls loudly)<br/>
<br/>
(Laughs)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? That's the wolf brain.<br/>
<br/>
Nice.<br/>
<br/>
(Both laugh)<br/>
<br/>
Man, this town sucks!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, bro. I know it's yours and everything, but...<br/>
<br/>
It's not even 2:00.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it does kind of suck.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I know this after-hours place over...<br/>
<br/>
A couple blocks off Cermak. You want to hit it?<br/>
<br/>
Hells yeah! Let's do it. (Exhales sharply)<br/>
<br/>
That's what I'm talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!<br/>
<br/>
(Howls)<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
(Both howl)<br/>
<br/>
(Both laugh)<br/>
<br/>
Not in her ear, right?<br/>
<br/>
Not in her ear, not in her ear. Hey...<br/>
<br/>
Bro, I never did catch your name.<br/>
<br/>
Saul. (Clears throat)<br/>
<br/>
Saul?<br/>
<br/>
"S'all good, man."<br/>
<br/>
(Laughs)<br/>
<br/>
Get it?<br/>
<br/>
I do... All right, Saul.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, brother, whoa.<br/>
<br/>
Check it out. What is that?<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit.<br/>
<br/>
There's got to be at least a thousand bucks in here, man.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God, look at that. (Chuckling)<br/>
<br/>
Whose is it?<br/>
<br/>
Mine.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, possession's like 4/10ths of the...<br/>
<br/>
What did you call it, bro? (Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Like, is there an ID or...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Some fat guy.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that one.<br/>
<br/>
Phew... Let's...<br/>

I got dibs on that watch, man.<br/>

Let me see that.<br/>
<br/>
What kind is it?<br/>

I don't know. It's just a watch.<br/>

<br/>
Well, then, let me look at it.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
It's a damn Rolex.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Not cool to be greedy, bro.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, I didn't know.<br/>

So, how do you want to split this up?<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you what... you keep the cash.<br/>
<br/>
I'll just keep the watch.<br/>
<br/>
But it's worth like 3 grand, man.<br/>
<br/>
$3,000 easy.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
(Scoffs)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
Come on, let's figure this out. We gotta get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
All right, yeah. You're right. You know what?<br/>
<br/>
I... sweeten the pot.<br/>
<br/>
I got, uh, $5, $20, $40, $60, $80... 580 bucks.<br/>
<br/>
Add that to the $1,000... It's more than half.<br/>
<br/>
What do you know about that thing?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, is it worth more than $3,000?<br/>
<br/>
No, I don't... I don't know. But we're good, right?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? We good?<br/>
<br/>
Okay?<br/>

Can we get more?<br/>
<br/>
God, I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
It's like a license to print money.<br/>
<br/>
(Both chuckle) A thing of beauty.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what was that, uh, crazy stuff about roundhouse kicks?<br/>
<br/>
Where the hell did you get that?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, man.<br/>
<br/>
Just something in my brain, you know?<br/>
<br/>
It just came out. Too much?<br/>
<br/>
No. I loved it.<br/>
<br/>
It was, like, deep or something.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Betsy</strong>: Please, okay? No one has to know.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you could just pretend you didn't find us.<br/>
<br/>
We would never tell anyone, would we, Craig?<br/>
<br/>
No, absolutely not.<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: I already called your lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckling) Besides, this little family outing of yours...<br/>
<br/>
It's put an innocent man in jail.<br/>
<br/>
The cops are investigating this as a kidnapping.<br/>
<br/>
They already rounded up some poor suspect.<br/>
<br/>
A working-class guy. Father... I think.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, you two... you almost ruined someone's life.<br/>
<br/>
Potentially several someones.<br/>
<br/>
I... we had no idea.<br/>
<br/>
Could this have been the person in the van?<br/>
<br/>
(Gasps) What if the man they arrested Is the one we were warned about?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent, hmm?<br/>
<br/>
Warned? Warned how?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we had a phone call. Someone disguising their voice.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, they said someone was coming for us.<br/>
<br/>
And there was a van outside the house...<br/>
<br/>
As if whoever was inside was watching us.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm. - And, uh, once that drove off, We... did what we did...<br/>
<br/>
For the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't know about any of that.<br/>
<br/>
I just... (Clears throat)<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that you and your family are safe.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, the police are all over this thing, so...<br/>
<br/>
It... it doesn't matter. Uh, we can't just go back.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's... our case. They'll crucify Craig.<br/>
<br/>
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?<br/>
<br/>
You know, tell her you didn't see us after all.<br/>
<br/>
If they think I ran away, it'll look like I did something wrong.<br/>
<br/>
We can't risk losing everything just because of some teensy mistake.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it's...<br/>
<br/>
Can I ask you something?<br/>
<br/>
What... what were you hoping would happen?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, before I found you, what were you planning to do?<br/>
<br/>
(Clears throat)<br/>
<br/>
Well, we were in the process of, you know, working that out...<br/>
<br/>
We were working that out.<br/>
<br/>
When you, um...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
All right, well, uh...<br/>
<br/>
You still got a little bit of maneuverability, all right?<br/>
<br/>
You... you're outdoorsy, right?<br/>
<br/>
So you went on an impromptu camping trip.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know. It's something people do, apparently.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you left the house a mess, and you kicked in your own front door because...<br/>
<br/>
(Breathes deeply) It's a free country.<br/>
<br/>
Kim Wexler is very good. She'll make it work.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, what... what about the money?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, well, if she knows about it, she'll tell, right? She'll have to tell.<br/>
<br/>
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,<br/>
<br/>
"it's not a bug... it's a feature!"<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever hear of a bargaining chip?<br/>
<br/>
What we have right here is the mother of all bargaining chips.<br/>
<br/>
Um, as in... You expect us to give this back?<br/>
<br/>
We are not giving this back.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, we are not guilty. This money belongs to us.<br/>
<br/>
We... well, I mean, Craig earned it.<br/>
<br/>
I worked very hard...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
You know, weekends, holidays...<br/>
<br/>
Yep, all unpaid, always.<br/>
<br/>
And, really, just because you're salaried, doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime.<br/>
<br/>
I think that's only fair.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, really, that's what this is about, right?<br/>
<br/>
Fairness.<br/>
<br/>
Fairness, right.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, not just what's legal.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to talk about legal, sl*very...<br/>
<br/>
That used to be legal. Human sl*very. So...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, this is right up there with that.<br/>
<br/>
(Insects chirping)<br/>
<br/>
(Children playing)<br/>
<br/>
Please, just don't tell anyone about the money.<br/>
<br/>
I can't take a bribe.<br/>
<br/>
Who would know?<br/>
<br/>
We won't tell anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, take it.<br/>
<br/>
I can't take it.<br/>
<br/>
Please, didn't you say that you wanted to help us?<br/>
<br/>
So just pretend you never saw the money. How hard is that?<br/>
<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
(Scoffs)<br/>
<br/>
Take it.<br/>
<br/>
I can't... (Sighs) I can't take a bribe.<br/>
<br/>
But... (clears throat)<br/>
<br/>
You know what? I... I can take a retainer.<br/>
<br/>
A retainer?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, for my services... as your lawyer?<br/>
<br/>
You're not our lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Well, not yet.<br/>
<br/>
Look... I know that HHM is shiny and it's slick.<br/>
<br/>
It's chock-full of lawyers and, compared to them, I'm like a...<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) A kiddy lemonade stand trying to compete with Wal-Mart.<br/>
<br/>
But here's the thing...<br/>
<br/>
What are you gonna get from me That you're not gonna get from those other guys?<br/>
<br/>
Passion, commitment.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself this... who found you?<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
I don't see Howard Hamlin... ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here.<br/>
<br/>
If you're with me, you're my number-one client.<br/>
<br/>
Morning, noon, or night, you call me... I'm there.<br/>
<br/>
I would be singularly devoted to you.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckling) But why not?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. You're just...<br/>
<br/>
Just... I'm what?<br/>
<br/>
You're the kind of lawyer guilty people hire.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(Brakes squeal)<br/>
<br/>
(Buzzer)<br/>
<br/>
Did it make the paper?<br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
Did it make the paper?<br/>
<br/>
Did what make the paper?<br/>
<br/>
(Scoffs)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, probably missed the deadline, but check it out tomorrow morning... front page.<br/>
<br/>
The Kettlemans, all four of them...<br/>
<br/>
Safe and sound.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you called it.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Camping... you know, pretty much right in their own backyard.<br/>
<br/>
Well... (Clears throat) Five miles above it.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, the night I had. I got pine nuts in my shoes.<br/>
<br/>
But, I mean, can you believe it?<br/>
<br/>
I-I guess you can. It's just, you know...<br/>
<br/>
You assume that criminals are gonna be smarter than they are.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
It kind of breaks my heart a little.<br/>
<br/>
Not the loquacious sort, are you?<br/>
<br/>
We can't all be as blessed as you.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Don't mention it.<br/>
<br/>
And, uh, if you ever need any assistance...<br/>
<br/>
(Indistinct conversations)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(Door opens)<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa. Why is my client in handcuffs?<br/>
<br/>
This man is innocent. He's a victim.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckling) why... why on earth would he be cuffed?<br/>
<br/>
Just go... go ahead. Take them off. There you go.<br/>
<br/>
Free at last!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, did he tell you the good news?<br/>
<br/>
Never even kidnapped... how about that?<br/>
<br/>
A family can't go on a little vacation without the whole city going on lockdown?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, where is your partner? What? Did you lose the coin toss?<br/>
<br/>
Because we expect an apology from him, as well as you.<br/>
<br/>
You really don't want to push your luck with me, scumbag.<br/>
<br/>
You got eyes on you, assh*le. One little slip... just one.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, you're... you're both very pretty, so...<br/>
<br/>
(Door opens)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Door closes)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) Well... (Clears throat)<br/>
<br/>
I believe I did more than what you asked of me, so, uh, that would make us square, yes?<br/>
<br/>
Great.<br/>
<br/>
You need a ride?<br/>
<br/>
Camping?<br/>
<br/>
You expect me to believe that shit?<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles) yeah, I know it.<br/>
<br/>
The things people do, huh?<br/>
<br/>
They decide to go camping Right after I run my little offer by you?<br/>
<br/>
Could be argued that all of life is one great coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
(Indistinct conversation)<br/>
<br/>
Somebody told those people to, um, go camping.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody warned them.<br/>
<br/>
(Clears throat) they're very woodsy.<br/>
<br/>
And between you and me, They're pretty rash when it comes to the decision-making.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, they're not really the plan-ahead types.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude right about now If I were you.<br/>
<br/>
You ratted on me. There will be consequences.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans, it was probably somebody who was worried about those kids.<br/>
<br/>
You know how much trouble you caused me?<br/>
<br/>
You didn't need any help getting caught, okay?<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor ID'd you. You were sloppy.<br/>
<br/>
Any trouble you might have... that's on you.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the blood in your van.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a thought... Ajax, formula 409!<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea the tap-dance I had to give those cops To get you out of here.<br/>
<br/>
You gave them probable cause out the wazoo.<br/>
<br/>
Now, and whoever the somebody is who may have warned the Kettlemans got them out of there before you did anything even more stupid.<br/>
<br/>
You should be thanking this good Samaritan.<br/>
<br/>
Because whoever he is, he did you a favor.<br/>

There were some special circumstances, so...<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue) Our elite-tier pricing would be... $950 an hour. (Calculator clicking) round it off to 20 hours. (Clicking continues) $19,000... Plus $1,000 for travel expenses. Consulting fees... $1,500. And, uh, research... Five for filing fees.<br/>

<strong class="text-strong">Jimmy</strong>: (British accent) Hello. You've reached the law offices of James M. McGill, esquire, A lawyer you can trust. Kindly leave your information at the tone, And Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.<br/>
<br/>
(Beep)</em><br/>
<br/>
Hey. Uh... It's me.<br/>
<br/>
(Scoffs) Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, uh, "The Thing" is playing downtown on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Thought you might be up for some Kurt Russell action.<br/>
<br/>
I owe you one, so why don't we just grab some dinner first?<br/>
<br/>
My treat.<br/>
<br/>
And... Uh, you know, if not, can you give me a call anyway?<br/>
<br/>
I really want to talk to you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Uh, bye.<br/>
<br/>
(Knock on door)<br/>
<br/>
(Beep)<br/>
<br/>
Come in.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey.<br/>
<br/>
How goes it?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, tricky, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner with the police.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the press.<br/>
<br/>
But this camping story of theirs...<br/>
<br/>
They've been keeping it consistent, at least.<br/>
<br/>
If it's okay with you, I think I should try to talk them into hiring a PR firm.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly for the next couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
So, okay on the PR firm?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a minute?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, of course. What's up?<br/>
<br/>
Take a ride with me.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, okay. Uh... Where are we going?<br/>
<br/>
(Engine shuts off)<br/>
<br/>
Whoa.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Shit.<br/>
<br/>
Yep. (Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
That's... I mean, that's my suit, right?<br/>
<br/>
Am I crazy here?<br/>
<br/>
No, you're not crazy.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the logo. That's our logo.<br/>
<br/>
He's just straight-up copying us.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?<br/>
<br/>
I really... h-h-he's, you know, a free spirit.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's one way to put it.<br/>
<br/>
You two are still friends, right?<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't exactly...<br/>
<br/>
You talk, though.<br/>
<br/>
Not really...<br/>
<br/>
Still, you're the one he called when he found the Kettlemans camped halfway up the Sandias.<br/>
<br/>
He was just looking out for his own client... that's all.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the third degree, Kim. I really don't care one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
I just... (Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
He's really forcing my hand here.<br/>
<br/>

(Knock on door)<br/>

(Bell jingles)<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Hey.<br/>
<br/>
Am I interrupting?<br/>
<br/>
(Bell jingles)<br/>
<br/>
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.<br/>
<br/>
Sit. Have a massage, free of charge. (Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles) Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Got to try the foot bath, too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, give the old dogs a rest.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
And go for the deep-tissue setting. Otherwise...<br/>
<br/>
Is that the small fist?<br/>
<br/>
Use the three arrows.<br/>
<br/>
I did. I pressed it.<br/>
<br/>
Just... yeah.<br/>
<br/>
(Chair vibrating)<br/>
<br/>
Now you feel it? Good.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, now relax, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Okay.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve a break today.<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
It's very nice.<br/>
<br/>
Told you.<br/>
<br/>
I get this free every night...<br/>
<br/>
Just one of the perks of salon living.<br/>
<br/>
The others being... Free cucumber water, obviously.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously. Free mani-pedis?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, deep discount mani-pedis.<br/>
<br/>
Because the ladies still got to eat, you know?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's still a deal.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
Living like a king, then.<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
What's this? Is this a cease and desist?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. How pissed was he?<br/>
<br/>
Well, his head didn't actually explode, but, you know, pretty damn pissed, like "this won't end well for you" pissed.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
How about that?<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
This is serious.<br/>
<br/>
I know.<br/>
<br/>
Do you? I mean...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell is with that billboard?<br/>
<br/>
I know you have a problem with Hamlin, but I...<br/>
<br/>
I just don't get your angle here.<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you trying to build your own law practice?<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you're spending god knows how much money turning yourself into a little Hamlin clone.<br/>
<br/>
I mean... Why are you making this personal?<br/>
<br/>
It's not personal? It is so personal.<br/>
<br/>
It is completely and totally personal.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no. It's not. No.<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes, it is.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) Stop trying to pretend.<br/>
<br/>
I can advertise, can't I?<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
What, do I have to clear everything past the great and powerful Howard?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can advertise, Jimmy, all you want.<br/>
<br/>
That billboard is not advertising. That is a declaration of w*r.<br/>
<br/>
Declaration of w*r? That's...<br/>
<br/>
It's right at Hamlin's exit. You know he drives by it every day.<br/>
<br/>
It's business. I'm building a brand.<br/>
<br/>
You're ripping off a brand.<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing original in that ad.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
It certainly doesn't represent Jimmy McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, all right, now, he fired the first shot, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Trying to keep me from using my name, my own name, Kim?<br/>
<br/>
I get that.<br/>
<br/>
But this... You're better than this.<br/>
<br/>
I'm better than this?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
I'm better than this?<br/>
<br/>
You are.<br/>
<br/>
Well, you're better than that schmuck Hamlin!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, come on, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
You could work anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
You could be somewhere where they appreciate you...<br/>
<br/>
You know, where they see how valuable you are, where, I don't know, maybe they care about you?<br/>
<br/>
Forget it, okay?<br/>
<br/>
If Hamlin wants to come after me, he knows where I am.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be ready, g*ns blazing.<br/>
<br/>
(Papers thud)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Beep) (Vibrating stops)<br/>
<br/>
The cease and desist is just the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is an injunction. You can't win this fight.<br/>
<br/>

(Door closes)<br/>
<br/>
Your honor, I'm a humble solo practitioner, merely trying to ply my trade In an aggressive and evolving marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
As I've argued repeatedly, this is trademark infringement.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McGill's new logo is an absolute copy of ours.<br/>
<br/>
I think it falls firmly under fair use.<br/>
<br/>
Fair use?<br/>
<br/>
You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply.<br/>
<br/>
It... there are only so many fonts out there.<br/>
<br/>
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?<br/>
<br/>
No, but we've been using this particular font for 12 years now, and it, in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic and Hamlindigo Blue, constitutes a trademarked brand identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa. Back up. Hamlindigo blue?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. That is our trademarked name.<br/>
<br/>
(Scoffs) Holy crap.<br/>
<br/>
You seriously named a color "Hamlindigo"?<br/>
<br/>
That is... yikes.<br/>
<br/>
"Yikes"? From the man dressed exactly like me.<br/>
<br/>
Your honor, I feel like I'm in the mirror routine with Groucho Marx, Like we should be standing, waving our arms at each other.<br/>
<br/>
Really? I don't see it.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the name McGill appears in both logos, which, I believe, Mr. McGill is hoping to further confuse potential clients.<br/>
<br/>
So I can't advertise under my own name now?<br/>
<br/>
I'm to be penalized 'cause I happen to share a name with one of HHM's partners?<br/>
<br/>
You can't take my name from me.<br/>
<br/>
The name is not the problem here, Mr. McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, he wants me to change my name 'cause he claims that...<br/>
<br/>
That... what... it's some kind of threat to his business?<br/>
<br/>
Your honor.<br/>
<br/>
This is restraint of trade, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever happened to the free market, huh?<br/>
<br/>
No, Hamlin here wants you to tell...<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I've... enough.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. McGill, I've heard enough.<br/>
<br/>
All right, yes, you are within your rights to advertise using your own name.<br/>
<br/>
However, in my estimation, the billboard clearly and intentionally duplicates elements of the Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill logo.<br/>
<br/>
You're actively copying their established brand for your own gain.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see any other reasonable explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Your honor, I...<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Wise up. The billboard must come down within 48 hours.<br/>
<br/>
This is a classic David vs. Goliath story.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you got your gigantic law firm Stomping all over the little guy.<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Woman</strong>: Can you hold the door?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but it's investigative journalism at its best.<br/>
<br/>
I-it's right up your alley.<br/>
<br/>
Uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, o-okay, well, let me give you my cell just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Uh... yeah. Thank you.<br/>

Can I get the news desk, please?<br/>
<br/>
I got a hot tip.<br/>
<br/>
Don't you want to be the station that brought down big law?<br/>
<br/>
You could be like the reporters that brought down big tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
Look, I'm talking Woodward and Bernstein here.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, your <em class="text-italics">exposé</em> on predatory ATM fees... that was... Wow!<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice,<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">And I think your viewers would be very, very interested</em><br/>
<br/>
And, uh, grateful to you for exposing this injustice.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">I wouldn't characterize this as a community health risk, But it's definitely in the community interest.</em><br/>
<br/>
No, yes, HHM is a pillar of the community, yes.<br/>
<br/>
No, I... the w*r is an important story, as well.<br/>
<br/>
That's why this action is so egregious.<br/>
<br/>
Sure. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Well, at least consider the human-interest angle here.<br/>
<br/>
Are you kidding?<br/>
<br/>
It's... lawyer pulls himself up by his bootstraps, Only to be ground under the heel of the old-money megafirm?<br/>
<br/>
That's hearts and minds! You... hello?<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs)<br/>
<br/>
(Beep)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I have your number, too, so...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I see.<br/>

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, man.<br/>
<br/>
Can't touch the goods.<br/>
<br/>
I signed the form... only I can touch the camera.<br/>
<br/>
Fine, may I suggest you widen the frame to include...<br/>
<br/>
The billboard is the story, okay?<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm also the story, so... Got to get me in there.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so, get on your mark.<br/>
<br/>
You know, uh, no offense to your minutes of experience, But I'd like to see what we got before we do this, okay?<br/>
<br/>
Other guy.<br/>
<br/>
Other guy!<br/>
<br/>
Only other guy that's here, go stand where I was standing.<br/>
<br/>
Uh... Shrink down. Shrink down.<br/>
<br/>
You know, scrunch. Yeah. (Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, widen the frame. Get the billboard.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me, me, me.<br/>
<br/>
No. Not me... get him. He's me. Yeah, like that.<br/>
<br/>
Got it? Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) Okay. Is he in the shot?<br/>
<br/>
No. Dude, just go.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) How do I look?<br/>
<br/>
Great.<br/>
<br/>
I'll, uh... no, this is my good side.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles, breathes deeply)<br/>
<br/>
Is, uh... is the billboard in? Yes!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus, just... you said $100 for one hour, not freaking 3.<br/>
<br/>
You clearly have a journalistic impulse.<br/>
<br/>
You're a real go-getter, you know that?<br/>
<br/>
Go get this.<br/>
<br/>
All right, count me down.<br/>
<br/>
In 5, 4, 3...<br/>
<br/>
Gravitas.<br/>
<br/>
(Breathes deeply) I'm James McGill.<br/>
<br/>
Like most Americans, I'm a self-made man.<br/>
<br/>
I put myself through law school.<br/>
<br/>
Working in the courts as a public defender, I represented those with nowhere else to turn.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in service. It's what I've built my career on.<br/>
<br/>
But I've also had a dream, a dream that many of us have...<br/>
<br/>
A dream to own my own business.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I-i scrimped and I saved, and finally, I was able to buy one billboard...<br/>
<br/>
A tiny foray into advertising for my fledgling law firm.<br/>
<br/>
(Sighs) I've always been told That America is the land of opportunity, And I believed it... Until today. (Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Not 24 hours after my billboard went up, a large law firm came after me.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">They said that I was hurting their business.</em><br/>
<br/>
They're rich. They're powerful. I'm just... One man.<br/>
<br/>
So, who do you think the courts sided with?<br/>
<br/>
(Clicks tongue)<br/>
<br/>
So now my little billboard comes down.<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something...<br/>
<br/>
If they want a fight, they're gonna get a fight, Because I'm not giving up, not...<br/>
<br/>
(Screaming)<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit! Dude, the dude!<br/>
<br/>
(Working guy screaming) Help!<br/>
<br/>
Dude, the dude!<br/>
<br/>
The worker guy!<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit.<br/>
<br/>
Please! Aah! Get me down!<br/>
<br/>
Dude!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, okay, call 911!<br/>
<br/>
<strong class="text-strong">Man</strong>: Help me! Ah!<br/>
<br/>
You got a cell?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Please!<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard from frontage road south of mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, man!<br/>
<br/>
(Grunting) Help me!<br/>
<br/>
Hey, man, I don't think that's very safe!<br/>
<br/>
You need to be, like, licensed for that!<br/>
<br/>
Working guy: Help me!<br/>
<br/>
Man...<br/>
<br/>
(Panting, grunting)<br/>
<br/>
Not looking down. One rung at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Not looking down.<br/>
<br/>
(Indistinct conversations)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(Grunting)<br/>
<br/>
Hurry up!<br/>
<br/>
Come get me!<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>
<br/>
(Grunting)<br/>
<br/>
Help me! Aah!<br/>
<br/>
Sir, I'm right here!<br/>
<br/>
Please!<br/>
<br/>
Please!<br/>
<br/>
Pull me up!<br/>
<br/>
Here, grab my hand!<br/>
<br/>
Pull me up!<br/>
<br/>
(Both grunting)<br/>
<br/>
Pull me up!<br/>
<br/>
Here!<br/>
<br/>
Aah!<br/>
<br/>
(Both grunting)<br/>

<br/>
You okay?<br/>
<br/>
Took you long enough.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">I was scared, yes.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I'm not really a big fan of heights...<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you.<br/>
<br/>
(Indistinct conversations)<br/>
<br/>
But, you know, something inside me said, "you have to do this."<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure our city's first responders would have been here momentarily.<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe this guy?<br/>
<br/>
But at least I was able...</em><br/>
<br/>
This whole thing was a publicity stunt. It's got to be.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">I think that's kind of all anybody wants when they're in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I didn't think...</em><br/>
<br/>
You don't think anyone's gonna actually buy this?<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to say. People love a hero.<br/>
<br/>
<em class="text-italics">You take it as it comes, right?<br/>
<br/>
The universe put me in that spot at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Who am I to say no?<br/>
<br/>
You know, as a lawyer, while I help people every day...<br/>
<br/>
Whole thing's a damn stunt.<br/>
<br/>
But I think my clients know... that when they're in trouble, I'm there.<br/>
<br/>
I was just a guy who was in the right...</em><br/>

You're early.<br/>

Did you...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I grounded myself.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, big day. My phone's ringing off the hook.<br/>
<br/>
I have three consults before lunchtime... three.<br/>
<br/>
That's great, Jimmy.<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
The worm has turned.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckling)<br/>
<br/>
That's really great.<br/>
<br/>
So, to what do you credit this sudden change?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I got to admit... you were right.<br/>
<br/>
How so?<br/>
<br/>
Well, you told me to keep plugging and, uh, you know... do good work, and the clients will come.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I'll admit.<br/>
<br/>
I almost lost faith a couple times, but the worm has turned.<br/>
<br/>
So, uh, what... you've been getting referrals from your PD clients?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, yeah. You know...<br/>
<br/>
You work hard, show you got half a brain, and people come knocking, like you said.<br/>
<br/>
I just needed to get my face out there.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
So, prosecutors, then... referring clients?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Yep. Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Was it Bergeron?<br/>
<br/>
When I was starting out, she sent me a couple good ones.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, uh, it was...<br/>
<br/>
It was someone on her team. (Clicks tongue) You know?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, hey, just took some elbow grease and clean living...<br/>
<br/>
People noticed.<br/>
<br/>
I knew you had it in you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't see the journal here.<br/>
<br/>
Right. Here you go.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
<br/>
Uh, Albuquerque journal... it's not here.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah. (Sighs) I didn't see it outside.<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't out there? It's always out there.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't see it. (Chuckles) Maybe they forgot to deliver it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some kids grabbed it. (Chuckles)<br/>
<br/>
Because if there's one thing kids love, it's local print journalism.<br/>
<br/>
(Chuckles) I don't know what to tell you.<br/>
<br/>
You got a ton of reading material there.<br/>
<br/>
Look, hey. (Whistles) Financial Times.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I know Albuquerque is a hub of global intrigue, but you think that'll tide you over?<br/>
<br/>
All right, fine. But if it's not here tomorrow, I'm gonna need you to call the subscription office for me.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, will do. Look, I got to go.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to be late.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, good luck today!<br/>
